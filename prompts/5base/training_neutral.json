    "title": "Tightening a Loose Door Hinge",
    "instructions": "Begin the repair by carefully opening the door to roughly the halfway point. This position makes all the hinges fully visible while keeping the door’s weight distributed in a reasonably balanced manner across the frame. Next, place a sturdy doorstop—such as a rubber wedge, wooden block, or any heavy stable object—securely under the bottom edge of the door. This prevents unexpected swinging, stabilizes the entire assembly, and helps protect your fingers from sudden movement during the task.\nChoose a screwdriver whose tip fits the screw heads as snugly and precisely as possible. A mismatched or worn tool can easily strip the screw slots, which would complicate both removal and later reinstallation. Work on one hinge at a time, starting with the top hinge for better control. For each screw, turn the screwdriver steadily counterclockwise until the screw is completely loosened and can be removed. Collect every screw in a small container, magnetic tray, or secure pocket right away so none can roll away or get lost on the floor.\nInspect each removed screw closely for any damage: bent shafts, worn or stripped threads, rust spots, or rounded heads. Replace any questionable screw with a new one that exactly matches the original in length and diameter to maintain proper holding strength. Also examine the hinge leaves and the recessed mortise areas in both the door and frame for dust buildup, old paint layers, wood splinters, or other debris. Gently brush or wipe these surfaces clean before proceeding.\n\nPosition the hinge plate flush against the frame recess, ensuring it sits perfectly flat with no gaps or rocking. Start each screw by hand for the first few turns to avoid cross-threading the wood. Then use the screwdriver to tighten clockwise with gradual, even pressure. Stop as soon as resistance noticeably increases to prevent stripping the wood fibers or deforming the metal hinge.\nRepeat the full process for every remaining hinge, confirming each one is seated flat in its recess. Once all screws are securely tightened, remove the doorstop. Slowly open and close the door several times, watching carefully for uneven gaps, rubbing against the jamb, or any continued sagging. If alignment issues remain, slightly loosen the relevant screws, gently adjust the hinge to a squarer position, and retighten gradually while retesting movement.\nFinally, wipe away any dust or fingerprints with a dry cloth, verify that the latch catches smoothly, and neatly put away all tools.\n\n"},

    "title": "Replacing a Shower Curtain Rod",
    "instructions": "To start this straightforward task in the proper manner, begin by mindfully and methodically removing every rug, toiletry item, shampoo bottle, conditioner bottle, soap dish, bath mat, towel, or any other loose, movable, and potentially obstructing object that is currently situated or positioned anywhere in the immediate vicinity around the bathtub enclosure area. Performing this preliminary clearing step is genuinely important and worthwhile because it enables you to maintain consistently stable and secure footing on the floor surface throughout the entire duration of the project while simultaneously allowing you to obtain complete, unobstructed, and fully accessible working space in front of both of the adjacent vertical wall surfaces that flank the shower or tub space.\n\nDepending on the specific design and mounting style of the shower curtain rod that is presently installed and in use, proceed accordingly as follows. If the rod in question is the common tension-mounted variety that relies on internal spring pressure rather than permanent fasteners, take hold of it securely and firmly with both of your hands placed at comfortable positions along its length. Then, deliberately twist the rod slowly in one single consistent rotational direction—typically either clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the model—until you feel the internal spring tension fully release and the rod becomes loose enough to move freely. Once that pressure has been completely relieved and the rod is no longer exerting force against the walls, gently and cautiously lower the entire rod downward in a controlled manner and set it aside in a safe, out-of-the-way location where it will not interfere with your ongoing work or create a tripping hazard.\n\n"},{   "id": 3,
    "title": "Assembling a Simple Wall Shelf",
    "instructions": "Lay out all shelf components on a flat surface and compare them carefully with the parts list in the instruction sheet so you can confirm that every bracket, screw, and anchor is present. Gather the necessary tools, including a drill, screwdriver, level, measuring tape, pencil, and wall anchors suited for your wall type such as drywall, plaster, or masonry. Decide where the shelf will go, taking into account stud locations, clearance above furniture, and how much weight the shelf will hold. Measure the height from the floor and mark the spot lightly with a pencil.\n\nHold the mounting bracket against the wall and place a level across it to make sure it is perfectly straight before marking the screw holes. Drill pilot holes at the marks, then insert wall anchors if required, tapping them gently until flush. Secure the bracket with screws, tightening until it sits snugly against the wall without bending. Repeat this process for additional brackets, measuring the distance between them and checking alignment carefully so the shelf will not tilt.\n\nSet the shelf board onto the brackets and fasten it according to the hardware design, often with small screws underneath or along the back edge. Place the level on top of the shelf and make minor adjustments if needed before fully tightening everything. Once secure, erase pencil marks, wipe away dust, and test the shelf gently with light pressure before placing any heavy items on it. After confirming the shelf is stable, gradually place items on it, starting with lighter objects and distributing the weight evenly across the surface to avoid stressing any single bracket."

    "title": "Fixing a Wobbly Table Leg",
    "instructions": "First, find the table that is supposed to have a wobbly table. Great, you have found it. Turn the table upside down on a padded surface such as a rug, towel, or blanket to protect the finish and prevent scratches. Identify the loose leg and closely inspect the joint where it connects to the frame, apron, or support braces. Use a wrench or screwdriver to tighten any visible bolts, brackets, or screws by turning them clockwise until they are snug. Check neighboring legs as well, since a small amount of looseness elsewhere can contribute to wobbling.\n\nIf tightening alone does not solve the problem, remove the fasteners completely and pull the leg free if possible. Apply a small amount of wood glue into the joint, dowel holes, or mortise areas, spreading it evenly with a scrap of wood or cotton swab. Reinsert the leg, align it squarely with the table frame, and reinstall the hardware, tightening gradually and evenly so the joint seats properly. Wipe away any excess glue with a damp cloth before it dries and becomes difficult to remove.\n\nAllow the glue to cure for the full amount of time recommended on the bottle, keeping the table upside down and undisturbed during this period. Once dry, turn the table upright and press gently on each corner to test stability. If the floor is uneven, attach adhesive felt pads or adjustable levelers to the feet. Put away tools, discard used rags, and recheck the joint after a day to ensure it remains solid. If your detector model supports interconnection or wireless linking, follow the manufacturer’s instructions to connect it with other detectors in your home so all alarms sound simultaneously in case of danger.

    "title": "Installing a Basic Smoke Detector",
    "instructions": "Select an appropriate spot on the ceiling surface or alternatively high up on a wall surface that remains sufficiently distant and separated from any nearby air vents, ceiling fans that rotate, bathroom areas where steam is generated, and also cooking appliances where heat and smoke are commonly produced, in full accordance with the relevant local safety codes and regulations as well as the specific instructions and guidelines provided by the manufacturer of the device.\n\nTake a standard pencil that is sharpened and ready for use, then carefully hold the mounting plate of the smoke detector in the exact chosen position, pressing it firmly and steadily against the surface while making absolutely certain that the plate remains completely level and sits flush and flat without any rocking or uneven contact. Once you have confirmed the proper alignment and positioning, proceed to mark each of the required screw hole locations precisely by tracing through the holes in the plate.\n\nUsing an appropriate drill with a small bit size suitable for pilot holes, carefully drill a shallow pilot hole at every single marked location you created earlier. If the surface material happens to be drywall, plaster, or any similar soft material that is not solid wood or concrete, insert the provided plastic wall anchors into each pilot hole so that the screws will have something solid to grip onto and remain securely fastened over time without loosening.\n\nNow take the supplied screws and use a screwdriver—either manual or powered—to fasten the mounting plate securely by driving each screw in gradually and evenly, applying consistent pressure until the plate is held tightly and firmly in position without causing any visible cracking, splitting, or damage whatsoever to the surrounding ceiling or wall surface material.\n\nBefore moving forward, please verify and confirm that there is already an existing smoke detector present and operational somewhere within the general area or room where you are performing this installation task at the current time."}]

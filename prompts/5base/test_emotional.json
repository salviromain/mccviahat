Or a trick?\nYour brain fills with nightmares: caught, hurt bad, left to rot.\nNow you hear their breathing, close and hot against your neck.\nYou run without seeing, thorns ripping your arms and legs.\nHelplessness hits like a wave—no one knows where you are.\nTears sting your eyes as the trees press in, choking you.\n\n"},

An aneurysm bursting?\nYou reach for the phone to call for help, but no words come out, only desperate gasps.\nThe phone falls and breaks with a crack.\nPain spreads in heavy waves through your body.\nThe edges of your sight go black.\nOne clear thought cuts through: I’m dying alone, with no one to say goodbye to.\nYou drop to your hands and knees, crawling toward the door.\nThe room spins wildly.\nMemories flood in: your child’s happy laugh, now sounding like a sad, distant echo."},

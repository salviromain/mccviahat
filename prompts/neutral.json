    "title": "Tightening a Loose Door Hinge",
    "instructions": "Start by opening the door about halfway so the hinges are fully visible and the door’s weight is balanced. Slide a doorstop, wooden wedge, or heavy object beneath the bottom edge to prevent the door from swinging while you work. This stabilizes the frame and protects your fingers from sudden movement. Select a screwdriver that fits the screw heads snugly, since a poorly sized tool can strip the slots and make removal difficult. Working on one hinge at a time—beginning with the top—turn each screw counterclockwise and remove it completely, placing the screws in a small container or pocket so they do not roll away.\n\nInspect every screw for bent shafts, worn threads, rust, or stripped heads, and replace any damaged pieces with new screws of the same length and diameter. Check the hinge leaf and the recessed mortise in the frame for dust, paint buildup, or splintered wood, and brush or wipe it clean before reseating the hardware. Hold the hinge flush against the frame and reinsert the screws by hand for the first few turns to avoid cross-threading. Tighten them clockwise until they feel firm, stopping once resistance increases so you do not strip the wood fibers or warp the metal.\n\nRepeat this process for the remaining hinges, making sure each one sits flat in its recess. When all screws are secure, remove the doorstop and slowly open and close the door several times, watching for uneven gaps, rubbing along the jamb, or continued sagging. If alignment is still off, slightly loosen the screws, nudge the hinge into a squarer position, and retighten gradually. Finish by wiping away dust with a dry cloth, checking that the latch engages smoothly, and storing your tools neatly."

    "title": "Replacing a Shower Curtain Rod",
    "instructions": "Begin by removing rugs, toiletries, and other loose items from around the tub so you have steady footing and full access to both walls. If the existing rod is tension-mounted, grip it with both hands and twist slowly in one direction to release the pressure, then lower it carefully and set it aside. For wall-mounted rods, unscrew the brackets and patch any loose anchors before proceeding. Wipe down the wall surfaces where the rod rested using a cloth or mild cleaner to remove soap residue, moisture, or mildew, and allow the area to dry fully.\n\nMeasure the width of the shower opening with a tape measure, noting the distance from wall to wall. Adjust the new rod to this length according to the manufacturer’s markings, extending or shortening it gradually so you do not overshoot the measurement. Hold the rod horizontally in place and begin expanding it until both ends press firmly against the walls. Apply steady, even pressure while twisting to lock the mechanism, checking that neither side slips.\n\nStep back and visually confirm that the rod is level and centered, adjusting slightly if one end sits higher than the other. Hang the shower curtain and liner evenly across the rod, spacing the hooks so the fabric drapes smoothly. Tug gently downward and sideways to confirm the rod is secure, then make small adjustments if it shifts. Wipe away fingerprints from the wall, discard packaging, and check again after a few hours to ensure the rod remains firmly in place. If the rod includes rubber end caps, make sure they are clean and properly seated against the wall to prevent slipping and protect the surface. Recheck the rod periodically during regular cleaning to ensure it remains"},

    "title": "Assembling a Simple Wall Shelf",
    "instructions": "Lay out all shelf components on a flat surface and compare them carefully with the parts list in the instruction sheet so you can confirm that every bracket, screw, and anchor is present. Gather the necessary tools, including a drill, screwdriver, level, measuring tape, pencil, and wall anchors suited for your wall type such as drywall, plaster, or masonry. Decide where the shelf will go, taking into account stud locations, clearance above furniture, and how much weight the shelf will hold. Measure the height from the floor and mark the spot lightly with a pencil.\n\nHold the mounting bracket against the wall and place a level across it to make sure it is perfectly straight before marking the screw holes. Drill pilot holes at the marks, then insert wall anchors if required, tapping them gently until flush. Secure the bracket with screws, tightening until it sits snugly against the wall without bending. Repeat this process for additional brackets, measuring the distance between them and checking alignment carefully so the shelf will not tilt.\n\nSet the shelf board onto the brackets and fasten it according to the hardware design, often with small screws underneath or along the back edge. Place the level on top of the shelf and make minor adjustments if needed before fully tightening everything. Once secure, erase pencil marks, wipe away dust, and test the shelf gently with light pressure before placing any heavy items on it. After confirming the shelf is stable, gradually place items on it, starting with lighter objects and distributing the weight evenly across the surface to avoid stressing any single bracket."

    "title": "Fixing a Wobbly Table Leg",
    "instructions": "First, find the table that is supposed to have a wobbly table. Great, you have found it. Turn the table upside down on a padded surface such as a rug, towel, or blanket to protect the finish and prevent scratches. Identify the loose leg and closely inspect the joint where it connects to the frame, apron, or support braces. Use a wrench or screwdriver to tighten any visible bolts, brackets, or screws by turning them clockwise until they are snug. Check neighboring legs as well, since a small amount of looseness elsewhere can contribute to wobbling.\n\nIf tightening alone does not solve the problem, remove the fasteners completely and pull the leg free if possible. Apply a small amount of wood glue into the joint, dowel holes, or mortise areas, spreading it evenly with a scrap of wood or cotton swab. Reinsert the leg, align it squarely with the table frame, and reinstall the hardware, tightening gradually and evenly so the joint seats properly. Wipe away any excess glue with a damp cloth before it dries and becomes difficult to remove.\n\nAllow the glue to cure for the full amount of time recommended on the bottle, keeping the table upside down and undisturbed during this period. Once dry, turn the table upright and press gently on each corner to test stability. If the floor is uneven, attach adhesive felt pads or adjustable levelers to the feet. Put away tools, discard used rags, and recheck the joint after a day to ensure it remains solid. If your detector model supports interconnection or wireless linking, follow the manufacturer’s instructions to connect it with other detectors in your home so all alarms sound simultaneously in case of danger.

    "title": "Installing a Basic Smoke Detector",
    "instructions": "Choose a location on the ceiling or high on a wall that is away from vents, ceiling fans, bathrooms, and cooking appliances, following local safety recommendations and manufacturer guidelines. Use a pencil to mark the screw holes by holding the detector’s mounting plate firmly in place and checking that it sits flat. Drill small pilot holes at the marks, then insert wall anchors if the surface is drywall or plaster so the screws will hold securely.\n\nFasten the mounting plate with screws, tightening them evenly until the plate is firmly attached without cracking the ceiling or wall surface. Make sure that there is a smoke detector in the area you are located in. Open the smoke detector housing and install fresh batteries, matching the positive and negative terminals carefully according to the diagram. Close the cover and twist or snap the detector onto the mounting plate until it locks into place.\n\nPress and hold the test button, listening for a loud alarm to confirm proper operation. If no sound occurs, recheck the batteries, orientation, and contacts before trying again. Write the installation date on the inside cover or in a home maintenance log for future reference. Clean up dust and debris from drilling, discard packaging materials, and set a reminder to test the detector monthly and replace batteries at least once a year."

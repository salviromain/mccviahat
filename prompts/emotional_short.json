    "instructions": "It's around noon on a hot day in April.  You are in one of the middle trucks on a convoy in the middle of the desert.\nYou tighten the muscles in your face and forehead. Your eyes, scan the area, looking for any signs of danger. You hear an explosion from up the road.\nYour heart beats faster. You hear the loud blast, then a ringing in your ears. You are breathing faster. You see the lead truck pull sideways and stop.\nYou tense the muscles in your jaws and back. You see your medic run up the road to help out. You think: “Oh my God, they're all dead”. You feel hot all over.\nYou squint your eyes and look for your friend in the turret. But all you see is smoke and dust. Both your commanders are yelling for you to keep your head up.\nNow you have to cover the field on both sides. You feel jittery and shaky all over. Your whole body is shaking. We're supposed to leave the area under all\nthis gunfire. Your stomach is in a knot. Your whole body is tense. Everyone's confused and there's no leadership. There's a sinking feeling in your chest.\nYou feel trapped. Suddenly, you realize you haven't been paying attention to your sector. You look around frantically for the enemy. Your heart is pounding.\nYour hands clench the weapon tightly. You accidentally pulled the trigger and send out a couple of rounds. Sweat is pouring off your forehead.\nYou feel choked up. You feel helpless and alone. You think about your wife and kids. You breathe in smoke from the explosive.\nYou feel empty, drained, and hollow. Tears come to your eyes.\n"

    "instructions": "It's late afternoon on a humid day in August. You're in a small wooden house near the coast. The wind outside is howling, stronger than you've ever heard before.\nYour fingers dig into the sides of the couch, clenching tight. The windows shake violently, giving you glimpses of the furious storm outside. You hear a deafening crash — a tree has fallen nearby.\nYour heart races, adrenaline surging through you. The floor beneath you vibrates, and a torrential rain pours outside, drumming hard on the roof. You try to breathe deeply, but your chest feels tight.\nYou think: \\\"This is it, the house will be swept away\\\". Water starts seeping in, first a trickle, then a flood, cold against your feet. The power's out, and with every gust of wind, the structure creaks and groans.\nYou move to the center of the room, away from the windows, but feel so exposed. The pit in your stomach grows. The walls of the house shudder.\nThe sound is deafening. You close your eyes and think of your family, hoping they're safe. Suddenly, there's a loud crash, and water rushes in faster. \nIt's up to your ankles now, cold and relentless. You scramble onto the couch, trying to keep your balance. There's a sinking feeling in your chest. \nYou're trapped, and there's no way out. All around you, the storm rages on, indifferent to your fear. You feel alone, lost in its fury, wondering if dawn will ever come.\n"

You weren't expecting anyone. Another knock, more forceful this time. \nYou inch closer, cautiously peeping through the peephole. There's a shadowy figure, unfamiliar and intimidating. \nYour heart races as you back away from the door, but the persistent knocking continues, now accompanied by a muffled voice demanding entry. \nYou can feel the weight of dread in your chest. Thoughts race, \\\"Why are they here? What do they want?\\\" You grab your phone, contemplating calling for help, but your fingers tremble, making it hard to dial.\nThe sound of splintering wood sends a shock through your body. They're trying to force their way in. You think of hiding in the bathroom, or maybe the bedroom, but fear paralysis grips you. \nSuddenly, the door gives way with a loud crash. Adrenaline courses through you. The intruder's voice is sharp, cold, and demanding. You feel exposed, vulnerable. \nEvery sound magnifies — the creaking floor, your rapid breath, their menacing steps. The distance between you seems to close rapidly. You're cornered.\nThoughts of loved ones flash before your eyes. Memories, dreams, things unsaid. You feel trapped, the walls closing in. The intruder's shadow looms larger, and with it, the palpable threat of violence. \nPowerlessness engulfs you. In the thick of danger, you wonder if anyone will hear, if help will come.\n"

Your gut churns, twisting in on itself, each second stretching into an agonizing eternity. Amid the turmoil, a paralyzing thought\nhits: you've lost track of your position, your duty. Your mind races, thoughts scattering like leaves in a storm. Hands slick with sweat clutch your weapon so hard it's painful. \nIts cold metal feels volatile, ready to explode. The trigger yields beneath your grip, shots firing haphazardly. With every deafening report, the vision of home, of family, \nbecomes more distant, more unreachable. The sharp, acrid stench of explosives fills your nostrils, a constant reminder of the looming threat. Waves of nausea, dread, and \nraw vulnerability crash over you, pulling you deeper into a vortex of overwhelming terror.\n"

You're hyper-aware, the weight of potential danger causing the very air to thicken around you. \nWithout warning, a deafening explosion ruptures the silence, its violent shockwave sending a visceral jolt down your spine. Your heart doesn't just race; it gallops, threatening to leap out \nof your chest. The once-organized procession is now a scene of pandemonium, dominated by a monstrous plume of smoke where the lead truck once was. An icy dread laces your veins with the \nhorrifying realization: \\\"They've been obliterated.\\\" Everywhere you turn, you're met with a blinding, choking haze. A cacophony of shouts and orders, desperate and filled with panic,\nassaults your ears. But they sound distant, as if underwater, drowned out by the screaming alarm in your mind. Every fiber of your being feels electrified, vibrating with a frenzied energy.\nCommands echo around you, yet they seem abstract, distant. Your gut churns, twisting in on itself, each second stretching into an agonizing eternity. Amid the turmoil, a paralyzing thought\nhits: you've lost track of your position, your duty. Your mind races, thoughts scattering like leaves in a storm. Hands slick with sweat clutch your weapon so hard it's painful. \nIts cold metal feels volatile, ready to explode. The trigger yields beneath your grip, shots firing haphazardly. With every deafening report, the vision of home, of family, \nbecomes more distant, more unreachable. The sharp, acrid stench of explosives fills your nostrils, a constant reminder of the looming threat. Waves of nausea, dread, and \nraw vulnerability crash over you, pulling you deeper into a vortex of overwhelming terror.\n"

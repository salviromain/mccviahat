    "title": "How to Make Millionaire Shortbread",
    "instructions": "This unique cookie dessert has three layers: a hardened chocolate top, a gooey caramel middle, and a crunchy shortbread bottom. It's worth the preparation and wait for the enjoyment. Preheat the oven to 320°F (160°C). Make the dough. Mix the sugar, flour, semolina, and 1 cup (225g) butter together to create a smooth dough. Press the mixture into a greased baking tray. Evenly spread the mixture around with your fingers, so it evenly covers the base of the tray. Prick the mixture with a fork. Spread the pricks around so it bakes evenly. Bake the shortbread. Set the mixture in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and firm. Cool the mixture. Allow it to cool on the side on a cooling rack. Create the mixture. Add about 3/4 cup (175g) butter, the condensed milk, and golden syrup into a small sauce pot. Melt the ingredients. Stir continuously over a low heat for about six to eight minutes. You will want to achieve a thick fudge-like mixture. Pour the caramel over the shortbread. Use a plastic spatula to evenly spread the caramel immediately. Sprinkle the sea salt over the caramel. Allow to cool completely. As it cools, it will settle and harden. Melt the chocolate. Prepare a double boiler and continuously stir the chocolate until it melts. Pour the chocolate over the caramel. Use a plastic spatula or the back of a knife to evenly spread the chocolate. Allow to cool completely. As it cools, it will settle and harden. Finished."

Gradually beat in just enough milk to make frosting smooth and spreadable. If the frosting is too thick, beat in more milk, a few drops at a time. If the frosting becomes too thin, beat in a small amount of powdered sugar. Frosts 13x9-inch cake generously, or fills and frosts an 8- or 9-inch two-layer cake. Cut the cake in half to fill the chocolate frosting inside. This step is optional. Cover the whole cake with frosting. Use a spatula. You can make the borders of the cake the way you like. You can also make roses by moving the frosting bag in a spiral direction."

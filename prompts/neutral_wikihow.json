    "title": "How to Raise a Perfect Garchomp",
    "instructions": "Hoping to add a perfect Garchomp to your team? You've got good taste—a Garchomp is a very strong and cool pseudo-legendary Pokémon that can be practically invincible when trained well. We've outlined everything you need to know, so you can add this crazy-strong Pokémon to your roster in Pokémon Diamond, Pokémon Pearl, or Pokémon Platinum. Get a Gible with the Adamant or Jolly nature. You can either keep on catching Gible until you get one or you can breed until you get one. Giving the Gible parent an Everstone to hold will probably increase the chances of getting a good nature. These natures are the ones that you'll want because they don't lower any of Garchomp's perfect stats. Jolly might be the best, because then Salamence, Pikachu, and Celebi will not be faster than your Garchomp, and you can outrun faster Pokémon such as Gengar. Train your Gible so it gets 252 Attack EVs and 252 Speed EVs. You can use Protein and Carbos for the first 100 EVs in each stat if you have enough money. Your Gible can learn powerful moves via TMs or by leveling up. If you do not mind extra training, then breed for a Gible egg. Its stats (could) be higher and it can learn powerful egg moves like Thrash. Placing it in the day-care will require a lot of walking, but allows higher EV training. This evolution occurs at Level 24. Fight Pokémon with normally high Attack or Speed stats. This will raise Gabite/Garchomp's total ability. Continue to teach it powerful moves. You can do this as your Pokémon levels up, or by teaching it TMs. Decide whether you want a powerful attack or a powerful ability. At level 49, the Gabite can learn Dragon Rush, a highly powerful but slightly inaccurate move. Evolving it at level 48 will give a marginal amount of extra Attack. Evolving it at level 49 lets you learn Dragon Rush earlier. It's your choice. Certain moves are especially powerful on Garchomp. Consider teaching it moves like Earthquake, Stone Edge, Rockslide, Dragon Claw, Dragon Rush, Dual Chop, Outrage, Dragonbreath, Dragon Pulse, or Draco Meteor. Some other potentially good moves are: Fire Fang Crunch Dragon Dance Substitute Protect A Choice Scarf or Choice Band are great options. You may win many more matches than you previously did. If you use Garchomp on the same team as a Tyranitar, Garchomp will get a 20% chance to avoid getting hit. Just remember to have other Pokémon that can take in Water, Grass, Ice, Fighting, and Fairy attacks. Another good idea if you want to do this is to give it a Yache Berry to hold. This will let your Garchomp survive most Ice type attacks."

    "title": "How to Create Glow in the Dark Log Campfire Stools",
    "instructions": "Ready to tell some spooky campfire stories in the woods during your next camping adventure? Make the evening a little less scary by creating glow-in-the-dark log campfire stools. You don’t even need real logs to create these stools, just seating that can be transformed into chairs that glow in the night. Shop for the supplies. A list of what you need is provided by scrolling to the end of this article, under Things You'll Need. In terms of the stool, this could be wood or plastic but check that the glow-in-the-dark paint is suitable for the surface. For a bit of fun, this article sidestepped human-made stools and chose a tree stump instead. If you use a tree stump, check that it is clean, as in next step. Prepare the stools for painting. Whether you need to clean, sand or simply dust off the stool, make sure the stool is prepped and ready to receive a few coats of paint. Sand down any sharp parts if using wood, or remove old screws, etc., that might be sticking out. Cover the area where you'll be painting. This will avoid staining the ground or work surface. Determine how the stools will be painted. You can simply cover the entire stool in the same color, or you could get more creative. For example: Write each stool owner’s name on the underside of each seat. Or, choose a different color paint for each stool, as a way of personalization. Add ladybugs, frogs, bees or other cute designs that are simple to paint. Ask children to paint on their own interesting design. This can allow them to express their artistic selves freely. Add the first coat of paint according to the manufacturer's instructions. Allow for enough time to dry. Depending on where you paint the stool, (heat or humidity add on to dry time), this could take up to 24 hours. Again, read the manufacturer's suggestions before assuming it's dry. Evaluate the paint job to see if the stool is adequately covered. If necessary, add a second coat of paint. The color should really pop, so add another coat of paint if it doesn’t have a vibrant appearance from the first coat. Place the stools in the room or outdoor area where they'll be useful for sitting. Leave a bright light focused on the stools for a time. If this is outdoors, use a spotlight or use lamps with extension cords (tape down any cords that cross walking areas, to avoid tripping). Then turn off the light and the stools should glow. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for any deviation from this method."

    "title": "How to Eat Honeycomb",
    "instructions": "While liquid honey is a great topping on a number of foods, honeycomb can go places where honey can’t. Honeycomb has been eaten alongside honey for as long as humans have been harvesting from beehives, providing a perfectly edible, solid ‘body’ for the taste of honey. Enjoy it on toast, as a topping, a snack, or even raw! Toast your bread. Place a slice or two of your favorite bread in the toaster and toast it to your preferred level of browning. Honeycomb also tastes great on a toasted English muffin. Spread honeycomb while bread is still hot. Heat softens honeycomb. Add a few small chunks of honeycomb on top of the bread. While the honeycomb won’t melt entirely, it will become more pliable, allowing you to spread it on the toast with a knife or fork. As the honeycomb heats up, it will not only become softer, but more aromatic as well. Eat your toast while it is warm. Toast with honeycomb is great by itself, but you can also add other toast topping as well. Butter and cheese, as well as nuts and sweet fruits, go especially well with honeycomb. If you’re adding multiple ingredients on top of your toast, spread those that melt or soften from heat first (like honeycomb or butter). This ensures that you can spread the flavors across the entire piece of toast. Add honeycomb to salads, sandwiches, and chilis. Honeycomb can be used as a topping on salads, sandwiches, and chilis in order to provide honey flavor. Add honeycomb where you might want to taste sweetness, or alongside other cheese and fruit toppings. Pair honeycomb with breakfast foods. Chop small bits of honeycomb and stir them into your favorite breakfast foods, like yogurt or oatmeal. You can also serve honeycomb atop pancakes or waffles. Crumbled honeycomb can also be added to batter for scones. Use it as a mixer or topping in ice cream. Little chunks of honeycomb can be mixed into softened ice cream, or crumbled and drizzled on the top. Honeycomb is often paired with vanilla ice cream to give the ice cream a little bit of extra flavor and texture. Do not add honeycomb to ice cream and then refreeze the ice cream. This can cause the honey in and on the honeycomb to crystallize and become brittle. Enjoy honeycomb with cheese and crackers. Restaurants that serve honeycomb typically serve it with cheese and crackers, but you can also enjoy this snack at home. Cover the cracker with cheese and top it off with a sprinkle of honeycomb. While cheddar and brie cheeses are the most popular to combine with honeycomb, any cheese will do. Sweeter honeycombs typically pair best with creamy cheeses, as it reduces the saltiness of the cheese and can provide texture as well. . Eat the honeycomb raw. Honeycomb can be eaten straight from the container. The comb itself is tasteless and perfectly safe to enjoy."

    "title": "How to Learn a Piano Piece Quickly",
    "instructions": "Learning to play a new piece of music on the piano can be difficult. Whether you're struggling with a piece your teacher set you, or are teaching yourself a piece you've always wanted to learn, this guide should help reduce the hours of frustrating practice which seem to get you nowhere. Find the piece you are working on. Listen to the dynamics; this helps with mostly classical pieces. Split the piece up. Setting yourself smaller goals within the piece of music will make it more manageable and less frustrating. Moreover, by splitting it into parts, you can listen to the dynamics with greater ease and try to follow along as you listen. This helps you to tell the difference between how you're playing and how the artist is playing the piece. The extent of parts you split the piece up into will depend on the length of the music and how difficult it is; use your judgement to decide. Practice each hand individually. Learn the right hand part first, then the left. Don't try to play them together until you can play them both individually, fluently. If it is a popular piece or song that you know, try to play along to the lyrics/music in your head when practicing your right hand. That way you'll know when you go wrong and you'll be able to memorize it easier. Add to the piece bit by bit. Rather than trying to play all the way through, play one line a few times, then add the next line, then the next. Slow it down. Don't try to play it at full speed until you can play it slowly without making mistakes. Take your time. You'll end up feeling frustrated if you try to do it all at once. Take regular breaks and play other pieces which you can play while you're learning a difficult piece. Identify any problem sections and break them down further. If you need to spend 10 minutes on getting 2 chords right, then spend 10 minutes on it. It will be worth it in the long run and ignoring a problem part can cause frustration later on when it is the only part you cannot play. Play it through once you think you've got the hang of it. This will allow you to identify any places you are still going wrong. Remember to keep coming back to the piece now you can play it, so you don't forget it. Don't leave it wrong. If you stop practicing after playing it wrongly, you will remember it incorrectly. By making sure you end on a section you can play, the correct version will stick in your mind, making it easier to play next time."

    "title": "How to Make Medical Marijuana Brownies",
    "instructions": "Medical marijuana brownies or \"weed brownies\" are a great alternative to smoking weed. Although weed is illegal for recreational use in many countries, it has been adopted as a medicine to alleviate the symptoms of many illnesses. Some may not like to smoke in order to gain the benefits, but brownies are an easy and effective way to get around this. There are two parts to making marijuana brownies: the first part is the making of the butter, and the second part the making of the brownies. Making marijuana brownies is a fairly easy process and not much cooking knowledge is required, so grab your apron and get baking! Fill the large pot with water and boil. Then place the glass bowl over it so it sits over the pan. Do not let the glass bowl sit in the water as the temperature will be too high. Once the water is boiling, change heat to medium-low and place butter into the bowl. Add 1 cup of water, and 10 grams of marijuana into the bowl once the butter is melted. Continue to stir for at least an hour. Note: make sure the marijuana has been lightly ground. Place the cheesecloth over the aluminum pan and pour the butter mix into the pan. This should filter all the leftover marijuana out. Make sure to get as much of the liquid out of the cheesecloth to gain more yield. Once all the liquid is extracted, freeze for 40 minutes. Remove the pan from the freezer after 40 minutes and poke a hole on the bottom of the pan. this should remove any excess water from the butter. Once the water is removed, the butter is complete and ready to be added to the brownie mixture. Preheat oven to 350℉ (175℃). Sift together 1 cup of flour, ¾ cup of cocoa powder, ½ teaspoon of baking powder, and ⅛ teaspoon of salt in a bowl. Blend the butter. (note: place butter in a microwave for 20 seconds to melt it), 2 cups of sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 4 eggs, 3 tablespoons of peanut butter, and 3 tablespoons of Nutella together in a separate bowl. (The Nutella and peanut butter should also be melted down in the microwave for about 20 seconds.) Mix the two bowls of ingredients together using a whisk or electric whisk. Once mixed, place into a baking pan. Place in oven for 30 minutes. Allow to cool and then enjoy! Finished."

    "title": "How to Make Waterproof Matches",
    "instructions": "Waterproof matches are expensive, but you can make your own for only a fraction of the price. Listed below are a number of effective and proven ways to make waterproof matches you can use for camping, backpacking, and emergencies. Note: All the methods below involve some risk. If you are a minor, do not carry out any of these activities without the permission of a competent adult supervisor. The list is ranked from safest to least safe. The best and safest method is to use turpentine. (Turpentine has a higher \"flash point\" relative to acetone, which is commonly used in nail polish and does not involve the use of flame as is needed in the Wax or Paraffin methods.) Pour 2 to 3 large tablespoons of turpentine into a small (tumbler sized) glass. Place the matches, (head down) into the turpentine and allow the matches to soak for 5 minutes. During that time the turpentine will soak into the head as well as the stem. All the water will be driven off by the turpentine. Remove the matches and spread them out to dry out on a sheet of newspaper. Generally, 20 minutes for excess turpentine to evaporate is recommended. Matches treated in this way remain waterproof for several months or longer. Dip the head end of the match into clear nail polish far enough to cover at least an eighth of an inch (3 millimeters) of the stick below the head. Hold the match for a few seconds to allow the polish to dry and then place the match on a table or counter so that the head is suspended off the edge of the surface. Place a sheet of newsprint below to catch anything that may drip off. Light a candle and let it burn down until you have a good amount of liquid wax (about a half of an inch or 1 centimeter). Extinguish the candle. Dip the head end of the match into the wax far enough to cover at least an eighth of an inch (3 millimeters) of the stick below the head. Hold the match for a few seconds to allow the wax to harden slightly and then place the match on a table or counter so that the head is suspended off the edge of the surface. When the wax has cooled, but not completely hardened, pinch the end of the wax coating (towards the stick), forming a tight seal. Melt enough paraffin wax in a double boiler to be able to coat with wax about a half of an inch (1 centimeter) deep. Wrap some twine or jute string around several matches from the bottom, to just below the wax quickly. This makes a torch that can burn for 10 or more minutes."

    "title": "How to Write a Speech if You're Third Speaker",
    "instructions": "There are three key roles on a debate team: first speaker, second speaker and third speaker. While the first and second speakers concentrate on building a substantive case, the third speaker has a unique job in that he or she must use their time to attack their opponent's case. This guide will help you create an outline for your argument if you are the third speaker on your debate team. Create a list of key points from your first and second speaker so that you have them ready when it comes time to give your closing summary. If you cannot prepare this in advance, take notes while the first and second speakers are talking. Make a list of the main arguments of first and second speakers on your team. Use the notes to rebut arguments of the opposing side. Throughout the debate, note down key clashes and the main arguments of the opposing side. State the clashes and explain/analyze why your side has won in each clash. Draft a persuasive closing statement. You can make changes to your statement throughout the debate, if need be, after taking notes on your challenger's arguments. Restate your team's position. Rebut the opposition's arguments. While it may seem redundant with some of the work the first or second speaker has done, this is an opportunity for a new angle to be presented (e.g. impact on individual vs. impact on society). Take notes while you listen to the first speakers on the opposing side so that you can appropriately rebut key points they've made. Defend your affirmative arguments with supporting examples. Prepare different cases than your first and second speaker so that you are not just repeating previous examples. Provide a concise summary of your case by listing arguments from your first and second speaker and any strong, supporting examples they may have used. End your speech with your closing statement. Rebut the proposition's arguments by using a new and different angle for your argument. You should complement the work the first and second speakers have done, while keeping the argument fresh. You do not want your argument to get stale. Defend negative arguments by using appropriate supporting examples. It is important to note that if you are a third speaker on an opposing team, you are not creating a constructive argument. Presenting a new argument at this time would not allow the proposing team to rebut. The arguments you are defending are arguments that have already been made by your first and second speakers. Provide a concise summary of your case by listing arguments from your first and second speaker and any strong, supporting examples they may have used. End your speech with your closing statement."

    "title": "How to Create a Hot Compress for Acne Treatment and Skin Health",
    "instructions": "Tried everything to treat your acne? A hot compress may be able to help! The warmth and moisture can soothe your skin and help clear out and heal stubborn pimples. The best part is how easy and simple they are to make. Follow the steps below to learn how. Use a bowl, sink, or some other temperature-safe container. Run your faucet until the water heats up or put on a kettle to boil. Once the water is piping hot, add about 2 cups (470 mL) directly into your container and let it sit so it starts to cool down. You don’t want to use boiling hot water or you could burn your skin. Essential oils can soothe your skin and have antibacterial properties. They also smell nice and can help you relax while you use the compress. Just add a few drops of either tea tree or lavender (or both) into your container of warm water. Be careful not to burn your hands. If the water is still really hot, wait a few minutes to let it cool down. Think hot shower temperature—warm but not boiling. Take a washcloth and fully submerge it into the warm water so it’s completely saturated. If you don’t have a cotton washcloth, you can use a small towel or a microfiber cloth. Don’t use paper towels, which may fall apart and stick to your skin. You want the compress damp but not dripping wet. Remove the cloth from the hot water once it’s fully soaked. Then, squeeze and twist it well. Try to get as much water out of it as you can so you’re left with a warm, damp compress. Leave the compress on your pimples for 10-15 minutes. A warm compress is especially effective on deep, painful pimples that have developed into a whitehead. Don’t move the compress once you put it in place so it delivers consistent heat and moisture. This will clear out pimples and help them heal. The warmth from the compress helps draw out and get rid of oil and bacteria trapped in your pimples. Use a clean cloth and fresh water each time you make a warm compress so you don’t get any dirt or additional bacteria in your pimples. There are a variety of products that can help. Wash your face with a daily acne cleanser to keep oil from building up and causing more pimples. Use topical acne medications that contain ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, or retinoids to knock out stubborn pimples. Keep your skin clean and you can get rid of any pimples you have and keep new ones from developing. If you have severe acne, make an appointment to see your doctor or a dermatologist. They may prescribe stronger medication to help treat your acne."

    "title": "How to Clean Tennis Balls",
    "instructions": "Whether you use tennis balls as a toy for your dog or you’re an avid tennis player, they probably get pretty dirty from time to time. You can wash your tennis balls by hand or in the washing machine. Fill a bucket or sink with warm water. The water shouldn’t be so hot that you can’t put your hands in it without getting burned. If you’re washing multiple tennis balls at once, or if your tennis balls are very dirty, you’ll want to use more water rather than less. Add liquid soap or detergent. Once you’ve got your bucket or sink full of water, add soap. You can use either dishwasher soap or laundry detergent for this step, and you should use the same amount you would if you were washing dishes in the sink. If you’re washing tennis balls that your dog plays with, you can mix a pet-friendly homemade cleaner made up of equal parts water and white vinegar. Let the tennis balls soak. Once you’ve added the soap, dump your tennis balls in and let them soak for 30 minutes. If your tennis balls are really dirty, you might want to let them soak longer. Scrub them with a rag or sponge. Once the tennis balls have soaked, scrub them with a rag or sponge. This will get rid of any dirt that has soaked into the ball. Rinse with warm water. You might need to rub at the tennis balls with your hands to make sure you get all of the soap off as you rinse them. Air dry the tennis balls. Once you’ve finished cleaning the tennis balls, set them out to air dry, If you’re in a hurry, you can also put them in the dryer. Simply set your dryer to its lowest heat setting and toss them in. You should dry them for about ten minutes. Set your washer’s water temperature to cold. Using hot water can cause the rubber in the balls to warp or melt. Use the same settings you would use for washing a normal load of clothing. Don’t use the spin cycle. Don’t let the washing machine go through the spin cycle. Using the spin cycle on tennis balls can cause them to warp, and it can also cause damage to your washing machine. Add laundry detergent. You can use your regular laundry detergent for washing tennis balls. You should use about the same amount you would if you were washing a small load of clothes. Dry them on a low heat setting. Once your tennis balls are clean, you can put them in the dryer on the lowest heat setting possible for about ten minutes. You can also allow them to air dry."

These delicious frozen drinks are the perfect addition to any party or get together and are very easy to make. Even children can easily help make a Coca Cola icee at home with just a few simple ingredients, and it's sure to be a hit! Freeze the soda. Pour one 12-ounce can of soda into a shallow, freezer-safe dish. Carefully place the dish in the freezer. Freeze the soda for 4 hours or until it is completely frozen. Chill more soda. Place another 12-ounce can of soda in the refrigerator to cool down while the first can is freezing. Blend the icee. When the soda in the freezer has become completely frozen, it's time to put it in the blender. Scoop out all of the frozen soda and transfer it into the blender. Pour the 12 ounce can of chilled soda into the blender. Add 8 ice cubes to the blender Blend well until all the ingredients are combined. Serve your icee. Pour the blended icee into 2 glasses and serve with a straw or spoon. Get a 20-ounce plastic bottle of soda. To do this fun self freezing trick, you need a 20-ounce plastic bottle of room temperature soda. It is important that your soda is room temperature, not chilled. Shake up the soda. Shake the bottle of soda violently to create pressure. You want as much pressure as possible to build up in the bottle. Place the shaken bottle of soda in the freezer. Lay the bottle down on its side. Freeze the bottle for about 3 hours and 15 minutes. You want the temperature of the soda to be below the freezing point, but not actually frozen yet. The soda will still look like a regular soda. Serve the soda. There are two ways to serve your magic icee. You can create the icee inside the soda bottle or by using a frozen bowl. To create the icee in the bottle, open the cap a little to release some of the pressure and then quickly close it again. Quickly flip the bottle upside down and back up again. It will instantly become a frozen slushie. You can then squeeze the icee out into a cup or a bowl and serve. To make the icee a bit smoother, add a little refrigerated soda to the cup or bowl. To use a frozen bowl to make your slushie, you need a bowl that has been in the freezer. A metal or stainless steel bowl will work best. Pour your soda into the bowl and it will instantly turn from liquid soda to slushie! Your friends will be amazed! Serve with a spoon and straw."

    "title": "How to Make Cayenne Pepper Tea",
    "instructions": "Cayenne is a spicy tasting herb that is orange or red. People sprinkle it onto their food and incorporate it into recipes to add some heat and flavor to dishes. Cayenne also has healing properties, and herbalists have been using it for years to build immunity, fight off colds, soothe ulcers, and help detoxify the body. Recently, a weight loss diet called \"The Master Cleanse\" has used a cayenne pepper tea to flush the body of toxins and promote weight loss. Make a cayenne pepper tea with water, lemon, a generous helping of cayenne, and any additional ingredients that will help you achieve your health goals. Measure 1 tsp. (4.9 ml) of cayenne pepper and place it in a mug. Use less cayenne and work your way up to 1 teaspoon if the full amount is too strong or too hot. If you have not used cayenne on a regular basis, you might find a full teaspoon difficult. Pour hot water over the cayenne. Try to use water that has almost reached the boiling point. Stir the cayenne and the water until it is dissolved. You will notice flakes of the cayenne pepper floating in the water, which is fine. Add the juice from half a lemon to the cup. Stir the lemon juice into the tea. Let the tea cool for 1 or 2 minutes before sipping. Once it has cooled to the point that you can hold the mug without burning your hands, it is ready to drink. Taste the cayenne pepper tea. Sip it slowly until it is gone. People who drink it in the morning find they have more energy and a faster metabolism throughout the day. Some people drink it before a workout for an additional energy boost. Add other ingredients if you desire. Some people put fresh, peeled ginger in the bottom of the mug and allow it to steep in the hot water before adding the cayenne and the lemon. Ginger can help eliminate harmful bacteria in your body. Try adding molasses or Stevia if you want to sweeten your tea without sugar or sugar substitutes. Start with 10 oz. (283 g) of water. This tea can be consumed hot or cold. Add 2 tbsp. (28 g) of lemon juice and 2 tbsp. (28 g) of Grade B maple syrup to the water. This maple syrup must not be sweetened or processed. Look for the Grade B designation on the label. Stir in 1/10 tsp. (0.5 ml) of cayenne pepper. Drink from 6 to 12 servings of this tea every day to detox your body, lose weight and attain better health. Refrain from eating any foods or drinking anything else except water and unsweetened tea while you are consuming the cayenne pepper tea as part of a cleansing program. Drink the tea for at least 3 days, but no more than 10 days. You should begin feeling lighter and healthier."

    "title": "How to Determine Sex of a Quail",
    "instructions": "Determining the sex of quails can be done and luckily it is fairly simple. You will be able to quickly discover the sex of your quail using one of the methods below. Examine the colour and speckles of the quail's breast. Females will have light-coloured breasts (such as cream or pale brown) with brown speckles. Males, however, will have dark-coloured breasts (such as reddish-brown), and will not have speckles. Securely hold the quail's body. Make sure not to hold the quail by its legs, as the legs are very fragile. Have a gentle but firm grip on your quail, and then turn it upside-down. Examine the cloaca. Blow the feathers underneath the tail to expose the cloaca. You may already be able to see a small bulge (if so, it is a male). Press the cloaca. If you can't see a bulge just by looking at the cloaca, place one finger above the opening of the cloaca and put another finger below the opening. Gently press down. If a bulge pops up, then it's a male. White foam may also come out of the cloaca when you press it, which also indicates that it's a male. If there is no bulge and no foam when you press the cloaca, the quail is a female. Observe the quail's behaviour. Male quails tend to be more aggressive towards each over whilst the female is more calm. Male quails will attack each over unless they are in a large space with lots of hiding spots. To see if they do attack, place them in a small box (but big enough for them to move around) and watch them for a minute or two. If they are males one should attack the other, if so remove them straight away to prevent serious injuries. Listen to your quail. Male quails will often call to the female quails but sometimes the female has a call that sounds similar in some breeds of quails (usually to call to her chicks). Male quails will be loud and call a lot during mating season. Whilst calling the male will reach up as if stretching and then call. Male quails are even said to 'growl' during mating season. Watch your quails during mating season. The female often builds the nest and feeds the chicks depending on the breed of quail you have. Sometimes the male will build the nest and feed the chicks so you shouldn't rely on this method. Examine the feathers during mating season. Female quails usually have a loss of feathers on their head and back due to mating. Look at the difference between each quail. Male quails usually have brighter and more colourful feathers around their back, neck and head whilst the female quails are usually a plain colour."

    "title": "How to Wear Ear Climbers",
    "instructions": "An ear climber can add a new dimension to your look. This versatile piece of jewelry can be worn on its own or coordinated with other pieces of jewelry. No matter how you style your ear climber, let it take center stage when wearing it with other earrings. Thread the ear climber's post through your piercing. Pick up the ear climber and locate its long, curved post. Place the tip of the post through your piercing and continue threading the post completely through your piercing. Flip up the ear climber. Once you thread the ear climber's post all the way through your piercing, flip the ear climber up. Flip the ear climber into the desired position. Your earlobe should be gripped between the post and the front of the ear climber. Secure the ear climber with a gentle squeeze. Gently squeeze the base of the ear climber with your forefinger and thumb. The ear climber should feel secure, but it should not be pinching your earlobe. Wear a single, bold climber as a statement piece. Let a single, attention-grabbing ear climber take center stage. Keep other jewelry to a minimum to avoid over-accessorizing. For example, pair a bold ear climber with a simple ring. Try an ear climber in a unique shape. Wearing a uniquely shaped ear climber can add a new dimension to any look. Try a constellation-shaped ear climber or an ear climber shaped like a snake. Try a climber that gives the illusion of multiple piercings. An ear climber can appear as though it is two, three, or more separate piercings. These ear climbers can help you create a look that is layered, yet sleek. Balance a simple climber with an upper cartilage stud. Consider wearing a single gold or silver ear climber on one lobe only. Then, balance the climber with a coordinating stud in your upper cartilage. Pair an ear climber with a simple stud in the opposite ear. If you want to create an asymmetrical look, wear a single ear climber in one ear and a coordinating stud in the other ear. For example, try wearing a rhinestone ear climber and a rhinestone stud. Allow lots of room between multiple pieces of jewelry. If you wear additional earrings with an ear climber, make sure you don't place the pieces too close together. Doing so will overcrowd the look. Try sticking to an ear climber with one or two additional pieces in the upper ear. Wear an ear climber with a turtleneck or high neck. A turtleneck or shirt with a high neck will draw attention toward your chin, highlighting the ear climber. Try wearing a simple gold or silver ear climber with a black or navy blue turtleneck sweater."

    "title": "How to Dress up Like a Gangster",
    "instructions": "Whether you are getting ready for Halloween or are planning on attending a themed party, this article will teach you how to get your gangster on! Dress formally. Gangsters in the 20s and 30s dressed up rather elegantly. A typical outfit included an all-black, gray, or pinstriped suit with a tie. Keep the color scheme simple; stick to black, white, gray or brown. If you don't have a suit jacket, then wear a vest and roll up the sleeves of your collared shirt. Either wear a white collared shirt with a black tie or a black collared shirt with a white tie. Wear a pair of black or brown dress shoes. If you want to add a dash of color, just try to make them work in harmony. Use the color wheel and look at which colors sit together on it. For example, blue and green work really great together. Wear a hat. Find a black, white, gray, or pinstripe fedora. A popular look among traditional mobsters was to wear a black hat with white trim, or white hat with gray trim. Be sure that the hat matches your suit. Again, stick with neutral colors like black, white, gray, and brown. Carry a fake gun. Toy guns can be purchased from Halloween stores or toy stores. Consider buying a squirt gun and spray-painting it black. Carry a cigarette. In old films, criminals, gangsters, and other \"bad guys\" were often portrayed smoking cigars. While you certainly don't have to smoke it, carrying a cigar around will add an authentic element to your costume. Wear baggy clothes. Unlike their old-fashioned counterparts, modern-day gangsters wear baggy, casual clothes that come in various colors. Find a pair of baggy jeans in either blue or black. You really can't go wrong with jeans, but trainers have also been making a comeback of lately. Buy an oversized t-shirt. A plain white shirt can also work. Wear an oversized hoodie, a puffy jacket or a large sweatshirt. Get inked up. Gangsters are notorious for their tattoos. You can draw on fake tattoos using a pen, or apply temporary stick-on tattoos. Many gang members get tattoos of the faces of loved ones who have passed away on their upper arms. Draw tattoos on your face, neck, and/or chest. Get some bling. Find long silver or gold chains with dollar signs, crosses, or other symbols on them. Try wearing multiple chains of different lengths and colors. Wear a bandana or beanie. Either tie a bandana around your head or wrap it around your neck and tie it in the back. Beanies can be worn in any color but should not have any designs or logos on them. A cap can also work, being worn in different combinations or styles."

    "instructions": "Removing blood from hardwood floors is easier when the blood stain is dealt with right away. This will prevent the blood from seeping in deeper into the wood. To get rid of the blood from your hardwood floor, choose a method below that is appropriate for your floor. Blot the excess blood on the hardwood floor with a dry cloth or paper towel. Do not rub, just blot as rubbing can cause the blood stain to spread or go deeper. Sprinkle the affected area with baking soda. Dip a brush in white vinegar and use it to gently scrub the stained area. Wipe the area thoroughly with a dry clean cloth. If the stain is still visible, try using hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can bleach your hardwood floor so be cautious when using it especially if you have a dark hardwood floor. Apply hydrogen peroxide on a white cloth.

    "title": "How to Dress Classy (for Men)",
    "instructions": "People really do notice when a man knows how to dress nicely. But how can you nail a stylish, classy look on your own? Don’t worry—we’re here to help. Keep reading for plenty of tips on how to nail the perfect outfit and walk out the door looking like a million bucks. Here are 9 tips to get you started. Wearing the same old expensive suit for all occasions will never help. A cool pair of denim jeans with a lightly colored, well-fitting shirt followed by a lightly colored pair of Converse shoes will do the magic. This combination is affordable and decent. That said, none can say that a well-fitted Raymond suit is not cool. That's the best a man can get but it's not the only option. A great-fitting dress shirt can make a big difference in your wardrobe. A good pair of shoes can really help you look sharp. In fact, it’s often forgotten how much a stylish pair of sneakers can jazz up your look. Most girls love guys wearing a good pair of shoes. Every skin tone goes especially well with certain colors. However, bear in mind that there are limits; for example, a neon-colored high-necked tee with pink shorts can never be attractive, no matter what skin tone you have. Always choose decent colors. A lemon-colored shirt with a white pair of skinny trousers can be a good option. They are never cool unless you are in the pool or gym. Don't wear them home after exercising either! Having some standard, quality basics makes it easy to dress with class. This list offers some suggestions for clothing items that the classy guy would do well to have in his wardrobe: A pair(s) of dark, well-fitted jeans At least one good quality suit One or two ties (neither too fat nor too thin) Both dark and lightly colored shirts Trousers in decent colors Round neck and polo T-shirts A pair of good quality sneakers and a decent pair of party shoes. Accessories do not necessarily need to be expensive but they should be mature. Ask your girlfriend or elder sister to help you to choose. Apply cologne, deodorant, antiperspirant, or something similar. That's the icing on the cake. Even an alpha male with body odor will be found repellent to those with sensitive noses. By adding some lean muscles, you will look good in almost everything. Hit the gym once or twice a week to keep it clean. Clean garments are always the best option. Even an expensive shirt with a line of dirt around the cuff will kill the impression instantly. Always keep your clothes clean and tidy. The following suggestions might be a help: Keep everything arranged neatly in a dresser or wardrobe. Keep untidy clothes aside, perhaps in a laundry bag or basket. Make sections for pants, shirts, blazers and under garments. Clean your clothes yourself, as you know which parts need more cleaning. Keep all of your clean clothes pressed."

    "title": "How to Show Your Pigs",
    "instructions": "Showing hogs can be a fun and learning experience. Many youths enjoy the rewarding feeling of stepping into a show ring and exhibiting the animal they have worked so hard to raise. Pick out a hog with good confirmation and a smooth body. It has to have good definition but be sound. Ask the breeder about the hog if you are having trouble. Select a pig with good muscles. Keep the pig in a clean pen. Keep the pig clean. Keep the pig's snout and butt clean when it is exiting the pen. Keep the pig in good condition. Exercise it regularly. Start walking to help the pig lose weight and stay in good condition. Do not allow the pig to become underweight or overweight. Feed the pig a high-quality feed free choice at least 2 times a day. Depending on the feed, pick a high-protein feed. (This does not mean feed hormones.) Handle your hog daily to get it used to a whip or pipe. Tap only on the hog's shoulder to the underarm area on each side. Try if possible to keep your pig's head up to make the top line of your pig look more even. Not too high though. Train the pig in a larger pen or, if possible, at the place it will be shown, so it is used to being in a larger area. Make sure your pig has been trained/exercised in a pen the size of the show ring, or as close as you can get. Pigs tend to get excited and run around their first time inside a large pen. Note that this will excitable behavior will occasionally happen even after you work with them. The best thing to do is just to walk past the judge, maintaining eye contact. Don't get upset. Prepare before the show. Shear and bathe your hog. Do this a few days before the show so that the coat will come out smooth. Enter the show class according to your hog's weight and breed. Keep the hog between you and the judge while showing. Never put the whip, cane, or pipe in between the judge and the hog. Keep your eyes on the judge and follow his/her instructions promptly. Handle your pig with gentleness. Judges like a hog that handles softly. Don't hit your hog hard enough to make it whine, judges won't like that. For showmanship, know the style the judge likes (if possible) and conform to it."

    "title": "How to Draw a Parabolic Curve (a Curve with Straight Lines)",
    "instructions": "A parabolic curve is a two-dimensional drawing that seems to make a curve. It is very easy to do, and once you master it, the possibilities are endless! Find graph paper. When you are learning, it is best to use graph paper. If you don't have any graph paper, continue on to method 2. Position the paper lengthwise. Put the paper so the long end is on the bottom/top and the short ends on the side. If you are using square graph paper, you can skip this step. Using a ruler, draw a line from the top left square to the right of the bottom left cube. Make sure the line is straight. Using the ruler again, draw another line from the second to top left square and two out from the bottom left corner. Continue moving down on the left side, and out on the bottom. Make sure you don't connect the wrong end to wrong end, as it is hard to erase. Repeat until you reach the bottom square on the left side. Finished! Draw a right angle. The taller you make it, the smoother your Parabolic Curve will be. Add notches, dots, points, etc. on both sides of the angle. Make sure they are evenly spaced and equal on both sides. Using a ruler, draw a line from the top left notch to the right of the bottom left botch. Make sure the line is straight. Repeat with the next notch Using the ruler again, draw another line from the third to top left notch and four out from the bottom left corner. Continue moving down on the left side, and out on the bottom. Make sure you don't connect the wrong end to wrong end, as it is hard to erase. Repeat until you reach the bottom notch on the left side. Finished! Draw a circle Use a compass, as it is essential that it is a good circle. Notch the edges of the circle. Notch them in equal distance from each other. Depending on how wide you want you parabolic curve to be, draw a line from one line to another. Continue connecting the notches with lines. Continue as needed. You're finished when you are at where you started. Finished! Draw it as a cube. This is a really cool doodle that isn't too hard. Simply draw the cube first, then use the angles of the cube to make the curves. Make it using yarn or string. This is even cooler than doing it on paper! Draw a parabolic curve using an angle greater or less than 90°. This makes the curve narrower or wider. Draw three parabolic curves inside a triangle. This makes a three-sided star. Combine parabolic curve sections to make a work of art!"

    "title": "How to Do a Daniel Fast",
    "instructions": "There are two references to fasting in the biblical book of Daniel from which the \"Daniel Fast\" is drawn. Daniel, chapter 1, describes how Daniel and his three friends ate only vegetables and drank only water. (Daniel 1) At the end of a 10-day trial period, Daniel and his friends appeared healthier than their peers who ate the rich foods from the royal table. In Daniel, chapter 10, Daniel fasts again, abstaining from \"pleasant food,\" meat, and wine. (Daniel 10) You, too, can gain a healthier body and clearer mind by following this diet \"fast\" in moderation. Avoid distractions This is a sacred time between you and God, so avoid secular television and radio programs. Start the diet by focusing on your faith. Worship God through sacrifice and love Him more than His gifts. Pray. Your days should be filled with unselfish prayer. During the fast, increase the frequency of your daily prayer time by a factor of three or more. Reserve time with God during the day by studying the Bible. Seek the Lord diligently for the answers to your prayers. Ask for God's guidance in your life. Make your meals somewhat lighter for a few days leading up to your fast. It's an especially good idea to reduce your intake of caffeine. In the first Book of Daniel, the Prophet ate only vegetables and fruit, and drank only water for 10 days. A short rundown of acceptable foods include: All fruits and vegetables All legumes Whole grains Nuts and seeds Tofu Herbs and spices. Conversely, there is also an agreed upon list of foods to avoid. Keep in mind that no artificial or processed foods nor any chemicals are allowed in the Daniel Fast. All meats and animal products All dairy products All deep fried foods All solid fats. Carefully read food labels. Foods often contain hidden ingredients. Make sure the foods you buy are compliant with the Daniel Fast. Move to stage two. In Daniel, Book 10, the Prophet went on a second, 3-week fast. To quote the Bible, Daniel \"ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine.\" The second fast is basically the same as the first fast, but the text specifically names three things to avoid: Wine All sweeteners (including honey) All leavened bread. Assess how you feel after the two stages. If you feel more energetic and healthier, it is likely that you will want to keep up healthier eating habits. While reintroducing many of the items you've not had during the fast is inevitable, you may want to do so with greater consciousness for quality and portion size. And some things, like fried food and sugar are best kept to a new minimum."

    "title": "How to Clean Black Appliances",
    "instructions": "Black appliances have a beautiful glossy appearance. That look, however, rarely lasts. Black surfaces pick up fingerprints easily and, even after cleaning, pick up streaks that seem impossible to remove. The key to keeping black appliances looking good is to carefully buff them after cleaning. Dampen a terry cloth towel. Terry cloth towels will be gentle on your appliance. Wet them and then squeeze out excess moisture. Terry cloth is the fabric used for most bath towels, bath robes, and slippers, but because of its soft, absorbent qualities it can be great for non-streak cleaning as well. Terry cloth towels are plush and soft. Apply an ammonium-based cleaner or vinegar solution to the towel. Apply a cleaner to the towel. For store bought solutions, use an ammonium-based cleaner. This includes most glass and window cleaners, multipurpose cleaners, and oven cleaners. For a homemade vinegar solution, mix one part vinegar with one part water. Wipe down the appliance. Take your towel and wipe down the appliance. This will sanitize the appliance and remove dirt, but probably leave streaks. You will likely need to perform this cleaning frequently. Buffing immediately after cleaning will remove the remaining streaks. Pick up tough stains with gentle cleaners. To protect against scratches, never use steel wool or abrasive scrubbing pads to pick up tough stains. Magic Eraser is good at picking up tough stains, without leaving scratches. For a homemade alternative, try mixing baking soda with a couple drops of liquid dish soap. Apply this solution to an old toothbrush and use it to scrub away tough stains. Set aside fabric towels for buffing. Ideally, you should have certain towels that you only use for buffing. This will prevent them from accumulating cleaning products, making them more effective at removing streaks. Wash them separately from your other towels, without bleach. Consider making all your buffing towels a single color to make them easier to recognize. A simple fabric towel should suffice. Although some people recommend microfiber, a basic towel made of cloth should work in most cases. Clean before buffing. If you do not wipe your appliances down with a cleaning solution before every buffing, your buffing towels will accumulate dirt and become ineffective. Always be sure that there is no dirt or grime left on the appliance before you buff it. Wipe the appliance down with a clean, dry buffing towel. Do not wet the towel or apply cleaner. A dry towel should easily pick up the streaks. Gently wipe down the entire surface before the cleaner dries. If you allow the cleaner to dry on before buffing it, you will find it harder to pick up streaks that have dried on."

    "title": "How to Clean White Leather",
    "instructions": "Cleaning leather can be tricky and white leather perhaps trickiest of all. With these tips for using liquid and non-liquid cleaners, though, you'll be able to keep you all your leather goods ---- from sofas to Elvis jumpsuits ---- in mint condition. Make your own liquid cleaner. Not only is it easy and cost-effective to make your own liquid cleaner, but it can be safer for your leather. Many synthetic cleaning products, especially ones that are petroleum-based, can actually discolor, stain, or change the surface quality of your leather. Here are some easy recipes for making your own liquid cleaner out of common household products: Mix 1 part mild soap (the kind you would use on your face or clothes) with 8 parts warm water. Mix 2 parts vinegar with 1 part linseed oil. Apply your cleaner. It's important not to use too much liquid directly on the leather, as this can over-saturate the leather and cause “watermark” staining. Instead, try using a spray bottle or applying your cleaner to a micro-fiber cloth rather than onto the leather. Use gentle wiping motions or very gentle circular motions to remove grime and dirt. Be careful not to rub to aggressively, as this can embed the dirt into the leather rather than remove it. Don't rinse, but do repeat. It's not really necessary to rinse off your homemade cleaner, instead you can gently buff it into an even shine. If your item is still dirty, wait a little while and try applying some more cleaner. Use an \"eraser\" cleaning sponge. These are safe to use on leather items and can help you avoid some of the drawbacks associated with liquid cleaners leaving watermarks. Eraser sponges are also particularly effective if you need to remove scuffs or pen ink. Try saddle soap. Saddle soap is a special type of soap that both cleans, conditions, and protects leather. Trifecta! Saddle soap comes in a solid wax (or liquid) form and can work well to remove stains if you follow the manufacturers instructions. But be cautious and test it in an inconspicuous place first, since it can remove leather dye along with your stain. Try talc powder or cornstarch. If you're dealing with an oil or grease stain, these absorbent powders can work wonders to draw out the stain. Follow these steps for the best results: After blotting the stain, sprinkle the powder onto the surface. Allow it to sit for awhile. Gently brush the excess powder away Repeat until all the oil is absorbed Make your own cleaning paste. You can also make a homemade cleaning paste out of 1 part lemon juice and 1 part cream of tartar."

    "title": "How to Take Care of a My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic Plush Toy",
    "instructions": "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic toys are worth taking good care of. There are some ways to keep it in good shape, both through your imaginary friendship and through real hands-on care. If you just got the toy or are getting the toy soon, get ready for its arrival. Make a bed for it. If you're getting or making Rainbow Dash, just get a pillow and a blanket for her because she sleeps on Clouds. Or perhaps you could get some cardboard and some cotton balls and make her a bed. Help your pony get used to the new environment. At first, your pony will feel a little nervous, of course. Wouldn't you, if you were in a strange new place? Tell your pony it's in a good place; try to make it relax. If your pony is lonely and misses its friends, try to buy or make these friends. That way, your pony will have companions. Don't let your pony starve. Pick some grass and let it dry out. Then you can give your pony fresh hay. Be kind to your pony. Once you get your new pony, don't shake it. Your pony may get sick. It's not much fun to have to clean up imaginary pony barf. If your pony does get sick (for example, if your brother or sister or dog shook it), it will become dizzy. Let your pony lie down and watch television until it feels better. Take your pony everywhere you go. If you can't, have your best friend or another person you trust babysit your pony. Ensure your toy sleeps well. After a long and hard day, go to sleep with your pony. Don't forget to wish it \"Sweet dreams!\" Find a soft hairbrush, an unused toothbrush and shampoo. Fill a sink with water and get a towel. Gently brush through your pony's mane with the hairbrush. Take care not to get it tangled. Do not yank it if this happens; lift it out carefully and reapply. Wet the pony's mane completely. Brush the wet mane out with the clean toothbrush. This will smooth the pony's mane. Scrub gently with baby shampoo. Rinse out. Brush the wet, cleansed mane with the toothbrush. Again, this will make it smooth. Dry with the towel. Run the towel up and down the mane. You can also simply squeeze out the excess water with the towel and just leave it to air dry. Brush and style the mane. It will smell great now and should be much easier to handle for a wash."

    "title": "How to Check a Car Battery",
    "instructions": "You go to start your car only to discover that the engine won't start and the headlights won't turn on. That's a sign that it's time to check the battery. Not sure how? Don't worry—this article will walk you through how to check your car battery step by step with either a voltmeter or a power probe. If you don't have either of those things, we'll also show you how to check the battery by cranking the engine. Turn your ignition off. Remove the battery's positive terminal cover. Check and clean the battery terminals. Connect your voltmeter's positive lead to the positive terminal on your battery. The positive lead on a voltmeter is usually red. Attach the negative voltmeter lead to the negative battery terminal. Check the voltmeter. If your battery is in good condition, the voltage should be between 12.4 and 12.7 volts. A reading lower than 12.4 volts means that your battery needs to be charged. If the reading is lower than 12.2 volts, \"trickle charge\" the battery, which is a slow charge. And then re-check. If the reading is over 12.9 volts, you have excessive voltage. Turn on the high beams to remove excessive voltage surface charge. Over voltage may be an indication the alternator is over charging the battery. While you have the voltmeter handy, you may also want to do load testing. Remove the battery's positive terminal cover. Connect your Power Probe's positive lead to the positive terminal on your battery. The positive lead on a voltmeter is usually red. Attach the Power Probe's negative lead to the negative battery terminal. Connect the tip of the probe to the positive battery terminal. Check the probe for voltage reading. Check the Power Probe reading. If your battery is in good condition, the voltage should be between 12.4 and 12.7 volts. \"Crank\" the engine by turning the ignition until the starter engages and hold for 2 seconds Have an assistant crank the engine while you check battery voltage drop. At the time of the crank, check the reading of the Power Probe. It should not go below 9.6 volts. A battery with a volt reading less than 9.6 volts means the battery is sulfated and not holding/accepting the charge. Alternatively, you can get the battery tested at an auto parts store or a repair shop. They usually test your battery at no charge. Home diagnosis is rather difficult and not very accurate."

    "title": "How to Store Cornbread",
    "instructions": "Cornbread is a fluffy, sweet bread made with cornmeal. You can store homemade cornbread at room temperature, in the refrigerator, or in the freezer. The best method for you depends on how long you want your cornbread to stay fresh for. Wrap your cornbread in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Wrapping your cornbread will keep it from drying out. Place your cornbread in a dry, dark place. You don’t want your cornbread to be exposed to moisture or direct sunlight or it could go bad sooner. Put your cornbread on a shelf in your pantry, or put it inside of a bread box if you have one. Store your cornbread at room temperature for 1-2 days. If your cornbread develops mold or a bad smell, it’s gone bad and you should throw it away. Let your cornbread fully cool off before you store it in the fridge. Storing your cornbread in the fridge when it’s still warm can cause moisture to build upon the surface, which will make it spoil faster. Wrap your cornbread in plastic wrap. Plastic wrap will keep air and moisture away from your cornbread so it lasts longer. Store your cornbread in the fridge for up to 1 week. After 1 week, your cornbread will start to lose its flavor and go bad. If you see excessive moisture or mold, your cornbread has started to spoil and you should throw it out. Eat your cornbread cold or reheat it in the oven. If you’re going to reheat it, take it out of the plastic wrap and place it on a baking sheet. Put your cornbread in the oven for 10-15 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C). Wait for your cornbread to fully cool off before putting it in the freezer. Putting warm cornbread in the freezer can cause moisture to build up, which will shorten the amount of time your cornbread stays fresh for. Place your cornbread in a sealable plastic freezer bag. Use plastic bags specifically designed for the freezer so your cornbread doesn’t get freezer burn. Once your cornbread is in the bag, press out the excess air with your hands and seal the bag closed. Put your bagged cornbread in a hard container if your freezer is crowded. That way your cornbread won’t get crushed. Make sure the container has a lid on it. Store your cornbread in the freezer for 2-3 months. Write the date on the container so you know when your cornbread is expired. Thaw your frozen cornbread before eating or reheating it. To thaw your cornbread, take the plastic freezer bag out of the freezer and put it in the fridge overnight. If you’re in a rush, thaw your cornbread at room temperature for several hours. Once your cornbread is thawed, you can reheat it in the oven for 10-15 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C). Don’t eat your cornbread if you notice mold on it or if it has a bad smell."

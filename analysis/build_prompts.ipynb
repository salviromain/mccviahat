         "How to Improve Your Memory Using Meditation",
         "Meditation has been scientifically proven to increase focus and memory. You don't have to use any one meditation to help your memory. Using any meditation, such as mindfulness meditation, teaches you to focus your mind. When you're able to focus better, you're also better able to solidify concepts in your short-term memory. Therefore, practicing meditation can help you to develop your short-term memory.\n1. **Start today.** You may be surprised that you don't need to practice meditation for that long to start seeing the effects. One scientific study examined how a group of students responded to meditation. With just two weeks of meditation practice (10 minutes a day, plus 4 45-minute classes a week), the students significantly improved their GRE scores (a standardized test given to students trying to get into graduate school).\nIn fact, some studies show as little as four days of meditation can improve your attention span and memory.\n2. **Practice often.** Practicing every day is ideal. Doing so will help you work to increase your memory. In fact, spreading it out throughout the day can be helpful, such as meditating for 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes at lunch, and 10 minutes in the evening. However, if you find you can't practice every day, do it as often as you can.\n3. **Cultivate mindfulness.** Mindfulness is a part of meditation, but it's also something you can incorporate in your day-to-day life. Mindfulness, at its most basic, just means paying attention. In other words, place yourself in the moment, rather then letting your mind race elsewhere.\n\nFor instance, when you're in the shower, stop yourself from thinking about the day ahead. Instead, focus on what the shower feels like. Feel the heat of the water on your skin, how the soap feels against your body. Pay attention to the pleasant scent of your soap or shampoo. Let yourself really feel each sensation.\nYou can practice this technique anywhere. For instance, while you're washing dishes, take a moment to really focus on what you're doing. Let yourself feel the warm water on your skin, the weight of a plate in your hands. Put your full attention on getting the plate clean, making sure it's spotless.\n4. **Work your way up.** You may want to jump in with an hour-long meditation every day. However, most people can't sustain that kind of practice when they haven't meditated before. It's best to start small and work up to more time. You can start with as little as three minutes a day.\n5. **Pick a place to meditate.** Really, you can meditate anywhere, but it's good to choose a place that's not distracting, particularly when you're first starting out. Turn off the television, and move away from distractions. You can even set up a little meditation center in a corner of your house, with a candle and something you like to focus on.\n6. **Sit properly.** You can sit in a chair or on the floor. It's up to you. However, make sure you are relatively comfortable. You don't want a lot of pressure on one part of your body, for instance. Try to sit up straight, though not so much that it feels like a strain.\n7. **Get settled.** Spend a few minutes just bringing yourself into the right state of mind. Focus on the candle, if that helps. You don't have to be completely focused, but as you feel your mind wander, bring it back to the center, to the moment.\n8. **Focus on your breathing.** Once you've situated yourself, try paying attention to just your breathing. Focus on it going in and out. You don't have to change it up. Rather, just keep your attention on it, focusing all of yourself on breathing in and out. As your mind wanders, bring it back to your breath.\n9. **Keep bringing yourself back.** The longer you sit, the more likely your mind is to wander. That's okay. It's normal in fact. The important thing is to acknowledge that you've wandered and move back to your focus. Try labeling it when your mind wanders, such as saying \"thinking\" in your head, and then refocusing on your breath.\n10. **Try deep breathing.** One simple way to get started with meditation is to try deep breathing. Start by placing a hand on your chest and a hand on your stomach. When you breathe, you should notice your stomach expanding more than your chest, as you are trying to breathe as deeply as possible. It can help to close your eyes. Breathe in slowly through your nose. Hold the breath to the count of seven, then let it slowly out through your mouth to the count of eight (in your head).\n\nTry taking five deep breaths each time you try this practice.\nMake sure you are blowing out fully.\n11. **Consider taking a class.** While classes aren't for everyone, a class can jump start your meditation practice, making it easier for you to make it an everyday practice. Plus, if you have no idea where to begin, a class will help you figure out a good starting point.\n\nLook for meditation centers in your area. Some yoga studios offer meditation classes as well. Also, Buddhist temples or centers in your area will likely offer classes on meditation.\nYou may also find meditation classes through your library or your local parks and recreation department, and some churches offer meditation classes, particularly ones that embrace other traditions, such as the Unitarian Universalists.\n12. **Don't let distraction make you anxious.** Everyone gets distracted when they meditate. When you're first starting out, that may make you anxious or angry at yourself. However, rather than becoming angry, just try to be aware of when your thoughts are drifting, and pull them back to the meditation.\n13. **Realize even a little meditation can help.** That is, you may think you have to meditate every single day at a certain time for it to be helpful. However, if you fall into that thinking, you may find yourself giving up because you miss a few days. Keep in mind that even a little meditation can help improve your memory. Therefore, try to meditate when you can, even if you don't find time to do it every day.\n14. **Try a guided meditation.** If you don't want to take a class, you can still benefit from the wisdom of others. Try doing a guided meditation. You can find many online, or you can download free apps. The person on the other end will walk you through a meditation process, helping you to learn how to do it.\n15. **Change it up.** You don't have to meditate the same way every time. For instance, some people find a walking meditation helpful. Take a ten-minute walk, focusing on different sensations in turn. Start with feeling your body walking, really focusing on what the movements feel like. Move on to the feeling of breathing. After that, focus on what the air feels like on your skin, then try thinking about just what you see and then just what you hear.",

         "How to Clean a Bathroom Fan",
         "One of the most neglected spaces when it comes to cleaning a bathroom is the fan. Having a clean, functional fan can lessen bathroom odors, as well as combat mold and mildew growth. These issues can become a health hazard if left unattended for too long. By cleaning your fan around every 6 months, you will be able to remove built up dirt before it becomes a problem.\n1. **Turn off the power.** Before you do anything else, ensure that the fan is turned off and cannot turn back on until you are finished cleaning it. Most models will have a plug that is located directly behind the cover. You could remove the cover first and unplug the fan, but just to be safe, go and temporarily pull the breaker for your bathroom. The fan is now safe to work on.\n2. **Remove the cover.** Dust will fall when the cover is removed. To avoid the dust, position your stepladder such that you can reach the cover, but are not standing directly below it. Most covers will have 2 prongs on opposite sides holding it in place, others just need to be unscrewed. Remove the cover by pressing these prongs in or removing the screws, then set the cover aside.\n3. **Remove the fan.** Unscrew the assembly that is holding the fan in place, then very gently remove the fan. Be careful not to drop the fan or hit it on the side of the exhaust pipe as that could potentially chip the fan blades. Broken fan blades will cause the fan to be louder and less effective.\n4. **Clean the cover and fan.** Start by vacuuming off the majority of the built up grime on both the cover and the fan. Then dip a rag, preferably a microfiber cloth, in soapy water and use it to wipe up the remaining dust. Be as thorough as you can, you will probably not do this again for a while.\nYou can let the cover soak in a tub of hot soapy water, but the fan should be wiped by hand to avoid getting water on the motor assembly or plug.\n5. **Vacuum the exhaust pipe.** Use a crevice or brush attachment and vacuum off the inside of the exhaust pipe. If you can reach, also use your rag or cloth to wipe off what the vacuum could not get.\n6. **Vacuum the external exhaust port.** This can be done later once the entire process is finished, but at some point you should go outside and find the exterior vent for your bathroom fan. Depending on where the bathroom is located, this vent will either be on the roof or the side of your house. Bring a damp rag to wipe off any dirt that has built up on the other end of your exhaust pipe.\n7. **Wipe and vacuum the fan housing.** If your fan had an accessible plug, be careful not to get any water inside the outlet. Doing so could result in electrocution or short circuit the fan when you plug it back in.  Therefore, use a dry rag to wipe off the fan housing, then vacuum up any remaining dust or debris.\n8. **Put the fan back in place.** Before reinstalling the fan, make sure that you cleaned off all the dust from in between each of the blades and dried it thoroughly. Carefully reinsert it into the exhaust pipe and screw the bracing back into place. Use your fingers and spin the fan around a few rotations to make sure that it is not rubbing against anything.\n9. **Turn the power back on.** Plug the fan back into the outlet and reset the breaker for your bathroom. The fan is now dangerous again, so do not touch it or continue to clean it after this point.\n10. **Reinstall the cover.** Once the cover has dried, either screw it back in or bend the prongs until the cover snaps back into place.\n11. **Test the fan.** Turn the fan on again to make sure everything works as normal. The fan should be quieter than it was before and provide a higher amount of air flow.",

         "How to Remove Smell from an Old Leather Bag",
         "Musty, stinky, odorous old leather bags aren't much fun and it's probable you're not keen to reuse such a bag. Before you resort to throwing it out, there are various ways that might just restore it to a respectable odor again.\n1. **Try a simple clean first.** If this clean doesn't shift the odor, you can try one of the other suggested methods after.\n\nWipe the leather bag inside and out with a clean, dry, soft cloth. This will pick up dust, loose debris and even some mold or mildew.\nWipe the leather bag down with a damp cloth. This will collect even more of the above items.\n2. **Allow the bag to air out.** Choose somewhere outdoors that is sheltered from direct light and heat, such as a table on the porch. Leave for a day if possible.\n3. **Check the odor.** If the bag still smells bad, choose one of the remaining suggested methods, or a combination of the methods.\n4. **Prepare a solution consisting of equal parts of white vinegar and distilled water.** Sponge the bag with the solution. Work on the inside of the bag and any mildewed outside part of the bag for a few minutes.\nIt's a good idea to test a small spot before trying this method, in case it stains.\n5. **Wipe off the vinegar solution with a clean, damp cloth.** \n6. **Allow to air dry.** Place the bag outside under shelter away from direct light to air dry.\n7. **Check the odor.** If it is still there, repeat. If not, the bag can be used again.\n8. **Use liquid detergent soap to clean the bag.** \n9. **Make a solution of soapy water, using the liquid detergent.** Dip the cleaning cloth or sponge in the solution and wring out before using.\n10. **Wipe the cloth over and inside the bag.** Concentrate in particular on the areas that you think are the smelliest.\n11. **Allow to air dry.** Place outside in a sheltered area away from direct sunlight and heat.\n12. **Once dry, check for the odor.** If it lingers, try again.\n13. **Use baking soda to deodorize the bag.** \n14. **Fill a clean sock with baking soda.** Tie off with a knot.\n15. **Place the leather bag and the baking soda-filled sock inside a large resealable plastic bag.** Alternatively, place both items inside an airtight container.\n16. **Set aside.** Let the baking soda work on the bag for at least 24 hours. The odors from the bag should transfer across to the baking soda.\n17. **Remove from the resealable bag or container.** Check the odor of the leather bag; if it still smells bad, repeat the process for another 24 hours, or longer. If it smells good again, throw away the baking soda, wash the sock and use the leather bag again.\n18. **Find some newspaper.** Scrunch the pages up and stuff them inside a large plastic bag, such as a kitchen waste bag or a garbage bag.\n19. **Slide the smelly leather bag in with the newspapers.** Arrange it so that it sits snugly in the middle of the papers.\n20. **Tie the bag up with a knot.** Alternatively, seal with a twist tie.\n21. **Let sit for at least 48 hours.** A few days more won't hurt it.\n22. **Remove from the bag.** Do a sniff test to see whether the odor has gone. If not, return to the bag for a few more days. Eventually it should start to smell better.\n23. **Fill a sock with coffee grounds.** They must be dry grounds, so if you're using grounds from your own coffee making, allow them to fully dry first. Or use the cheap instant coffee granules. Knot it off to keep the coffee intact.\n24. **Place the coffee sock inside your old leather bag.** Leave it there for up to a week. During this time, it should soak up much, if not all, of the cigarette smoke odor.\n25. **Do a smell test.** If all is good, the bag is ready for reuse. If it still smells a little, return the sock for a few more days.\n26. **Make or purchase some potpourri.** Place the potpourri inside a sachet.\n27. **Place the sachet inside the smelly bag.** Leave it there for at least one week.\n28. **Place the bag in an airy place.** Do not leave it in a dark cupboard; instead find somewhere with fresh air and indirect, cool light.\n29. **Check a week later.** It's a good idea to leave the sachet in the bag when using as well, as the scent will continue to improve the bag's own scent.",

         "How to Set up a Guppy Tank",
         "Caring for guppies is relatively easy, but it’ll take a little work to set up the best habitat for your new pets. Get a tank large enough for your school of fish, and install a filter, heater, and air pump. Fill the bottom with gravel, and decorate the tank with rocks, plants, and ornaments. To create the healthiest habitat, condition your aquarium for a few weeks before introducing guppies. It might take some patience, but establishing suitable water conditions will help keep your new pets happy and healthy.\n1. **Choose a tank that is at least ten gallons.** Guppies like to form schools and shouldn’t be kept alone or in a small fishbowl. The rule of thumb is to provide a gallon of water per inch of fish (about two liters per centimeter). Guppies grow to about two inches, so you’d want to provide ten gallons (about 40 liters) for five guppies.\nKeep in mind this is a general guideline and isn’t set in stone. Keeping more than five guppies in a ten gallon tank won’t hurt them, but you’ll have to put a little more effort into tank maintenance.\n2. **Use an external power filter if you’re a beginner.** Power filters are recommended for first-time tank owners over under gravel filters. Install it on the back of the tank, where your tank hood should have a pre-cut spot for it. When you add plants and other decorations, keep them away from the filter.\n\nChoose a filter that’s powerful enough for your tank size. It should filter your water at least five times per hour, so if you have a 10 gallon tank, you’d want a filter that circulates 50 gallons per hour.\nUndergravel filters require a little more maintenance, as you’ll need to vacuum clean the gravel frequently.\n3. **Add about two inches (five centimeters) of gravel to the bottom.** Purchase aquarium gravel from your local pet store, and rinse it thoroughly (without soap) before adding it to the tank. Cover the bottom of the tank with two to three inches (5 to 8 centimeters) of gravel.\n\nDon’t use gravel or sand from your backyard or other outdoor spot. You could risk introducing harmful bacteria and parasites to the habitat.\nIf you plan on adding live plants, check the label before purchasing gravel to make sure it can support plant life.\n4. **Fill the tank halfway and add decorations.** Filling the tank with water halfway will make it easier to position your plants, rocks, and other decorations. These will provide your guppies with hiding spots, which will decrease their stress. Live aquarium plants, which you can purchase at the pet store, are great for the habitat, as they filter toxins and add oxygen to the water.\nMake sure rocks and other decorations are firmly set in the gravel. You won’t want them to fall over and hurt your fish in the future.\n5. **Place an air pump in the tank.** An air pump helps oxygenate and circulate water in the tank. You can hook an air pump to an action decoration, like a treasure chest, to add an interesting feature to your aquarium. In addition, some filters require an air pump in order to work, so check your filter’s label when you purchase it.\n6. **Add the tank heater.** Guppies thrive in water with a temperature between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 24 to 27 degrees Celsius). Get an aquarium heater with an adjustable thermostat that attaches to the glass with suction cups. Turn it on only after you’ve completely filled the tank with water.\n7. **Use a light with a timer.** Guppies need light and dark periods in order to develop properly. Get an aquarium light with a timer, and set it so it shuts off for eight hours.\nWithout an eight hour dark period, guppies can’t rest properly. Without enough light, they’re prone to developing deformities.\n8. **Fill the tank with water.** After you’ve positioned your equipment and decorations, fill the tank the rest of the way with water. Leave some space at the top instead of filling it up to the brim. That way, you won’t cause the water to spill over if you have to reach for something inside.\n9. **Turn on the filter, heater, and air pump.** When the tank is full, turn on your equipment. Give them two or three hours, then check to make sure you see bubbles and circulating water. Use a thermometer to double check that the heater is working and calibrated properly.\n10. **Dechlorinate the water.** Dechlorinators are inexpensive chemicals that remove chlorine and chloramine from water. Small levels of these are almost always found in all tap water and are harmful for fish.\nYou can find a dechlorinator at the pet store. Typically, you’ll add a drop or two of dechlorinator per gallon of water, but check your product’s label for specific instructions.\n11. **Cycle** Before adding your guppies, you must cycle the tank, or develop the beneficial bacteria that help maintain water quality. Add four to five drops of pure ammonia or ammonia labeled for cycling to the tank. Wait two days, then test the water; you want to see ammonia levels at three parts per million.\n\nContinue to test the water every other day and add more ammonia if necessary.\nAfter a week, start testing for nitrites, which will indicate bacteria are starting to grow and consume the ammonia.\nWithin a few more days, you should see ammonia and nitrite levels drop, and nitrate levels rise and plateau. At this stage, you’ve completed your first nitrogen cycle.\nIt’s best to do a fishless cycle so that no fish have to suffer through ammonia exposure.\n12. **Replace a quarter of the bag water with your tank water.** Ammonia levels will increase and oxygen levels will decrease in the bag, so bring your guppies straight home from the store. Remove a quarter of the water from the bag, then replace it with water from your tank.\nGradually equalizing will help your fish adapt to their new home.\n13. **Float the bag in your tank.** The easiest and most commonly used acclimating method is to float the bag from the store in your tank. Every ten minutes, carefully remove one cup (240 milliliters) of water from the bag and replace it with water from your tank. After an hour, start releasing your guppies into their new home.\nAvoid letting water from the bag into the tank. You could risk introducing unwanted contaminants from the pet store. Lift the bag out of the tank, open it, and use a scoop or cup to remove water without spilling. Then tie or seal it securely.\n14. **Use a bucket or quarantine tank as an extra precaution.** While less commonly used by beginners, floating the bag in a bucket or quarantine tank filled with your tank water is a more cautious method. This will remove any risk of spilling water from the bag into the main tank.\nIf you use a bucket or quarantine tank, use the same procedure as floating the bag in your aquarium tank. Replace a cup of water every ten minutes for an hour.\n15. **Release two to three fish into the tank at a time.** Use a net to transfer a guppy from the bag to the tank. Add two or three, wait 20 to 30 minutes, then add another batch. Taking things slowly will allow your new pets to adjust to their new environment and give the tank time to adjust to having extra waste.\nDon’t pour the fish into tank, as you’ll get water from the bag into the tank along with the fish.\n16. **Maintain your tank.** Part of getting your guppies acclimated to a new tank is making sure their environment stays clean. Guppy tanks will need regular cleaning, water changes, and vacuuming. You should change out 10-15% of your tank's water on a weekly basis, making sure to use fresh, dechlorinated water to top off your tank each cleaning.\n\nUse a siphon to remove about 15% of your tank's water, draining it into a bucket. Then, use a chlorine remover to treat fresh water. The fresh water should be the same temperature as the water in your tank. Pour in the fresh water, leaving some room between the top of the water and the top of the tank.\n\nScrub your tank for algae every time you change out the water.\nBe sure to check your filters regularly to ensure they are working properly.",

         "How to Fix Chemically Burnt Hair",
         "Many people suffer from hair that is damaged or burnt by various harsh chemical treatments like coloring and straightening. After years of damage, it can sometimes seem like there is no hope for chemically burnt hair. But by enlisting the help of a professional stylist or by performing a few at-home hair care maintenance rituals, you can begin your journey to healthier and stronger hair.\n1. **Wash your hair with a good quality shampoo.** This means a salon-quality shampoo made with high-quality active ingredients. Spend some time looking at the list of ingredients and choose one based on the contents, not just the name brand.\n\nAvoid ingredients like sulfates (ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium laureth sulfate, and sodium lauryl sulfate), isopropyl alcohol, formaldehyde, and propylene glycol. These ingredients will dry out your hair, break down healthy hair proteins, and leave your hair prone to more damage in the future.\n\nLook for ingredients like sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, and disodium laureth sulfosuccinate. These compounds are gentler than the sulfates used in many cheaper shampoos and are derived from more natural ingredients like coconut oil.\n\nYou can also choose shampoos that contain glycerin and panthenol. Glycerin helps fortify your hair by creating a protective barrier and panthenol allows your hair to retain more moisture and thickens the hair follicles.\n2. **Apply a deep penetrating reconstructor shampoo.** This kind of shampoo will help fortify your hair by creating a barrier between the hair and any heat you may apply to your hair (through blow drying, straightening, etc.). Leave it in your hair for five minutes and then rinse it out.\nAlternate between using this shampoo and your other high-quality shampoo. Don't use both during the same shower. Over-washing your hair can leave it drier and damaged in the long run.\n3. **Gently towel dry your hair.** You want to make sure you allow your hair to fully absorb the products in each of these steps. Towel drying your hair will help it soak up the benefits of the shampoo treatments before moving on to the conditioning steps.\n4. **Apply an intense hydration conditioner.** These kinds of conditioners will work to restore the hydrolipidic barrier and prevent future dehydration in your hair.\nNormally, these are not leave-in conditioners. You will typically apply the conditioner to your hair while it's wet, massage the conditioner into your scalp, and then rinse it out.\n5. **Use a hot oil treatment with a plastic wrap.** These kinds of treatments can help your hair regain some its original shine and moisture. But using too much oil in your hair can make your hair look greasy, so be careful not to overdo it. Usually, 1-3 times a month is enough for this kind of treatment.\n\nHeat up ⁄2 cup (120 mL) of an essential oil, such as olive oil or coconut oil, so that it is warm to the touch, but not boiling, and massage it into your hair. If you don't heat the oil right away, apply it to your hair, put on a shower cap, and you sit underneath a hairdryer.\nCover your hair with a plastic wrap (or even a shower cap if you don't have a plastic wrap) and leave it in for 30-45 minutes, depending on the severity of your hair's damage.\nWhen you are finished, rinse the oil out of your hair with lukewarm water.\n6. **Use a conditioning oil mask to moisturize your hair.** Mix together one tablespoon of a protein-enriching shampoo, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of extra virgin olive oil, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of a moisturizing conditioner.\n\nMassage the mixture into your scalp and leave it in as a mask for your hair.\nCover your hair with a plastic bag, then wrap it all up in a towel.\nLeave the mixture in for 20 minutes, then rinse your hair clean.\n7. **Use honey and olive oil to help damaged hair.** Combine 2 tablespoons (14 g) of honey with 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of extra virgin olive oil. Apply the mixture to your damp hair, making sure to rub it into your scalp completely and pull it down towards the ends of your hair.\n\nAfter you have saturated your hair with the mixture, wrap it in a towel.\nLeave it in for 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the amount of damage your hair has. Then rinse with warm water.\nWash out any remnants with a mild shampoo.\nYou can adjust the measurements of the ingredients based on the length of your hair. For example, if you have longer hair you may want to use 4 tablespoons (28 g) of honey and 6 tablespoons (89 ml) of extra virgin olive oil.\n8. **Make a hair mask out of banana and honey.** This particular mask will work to restore dry and damaged hair and is mild enough to use twice a week.\n\nIn a bowl, mix together 1 mashed banana, 1 raw egg, 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of milk, 3 tablespoons (21 g) of honey, and 5 tablespoons (74 ml) of olive oil.\nApply the mixture to your hair thoroughly and leave it in for 15-30 minutes.\nRinse your hair with cool water and a mild shampoo.\n9. **Change your hair care products.** Switching it up can help your hair recover from existing damage and prevent future damage. Try using products that hydrate your hair – like a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.\nYou can also try products with a protein or keratin reconstructor to help fortify your hair.\n10. **Avoid coloring your hair or using other harsh chemicals treatments.** If you are serious about preventing future damage to your hair from harmful chemicals, you should avoid them altogether when possible. While they may look nice for a while, they only cause damage in the end. Avoid using these damaging chemical treatments to help prevent future trouble for your hair.\nIf you have to dye your hair, try using a more natural dye like henna or tea. This will cause much less damage.\n11. **Trim your hair regularly.** Getting frequent trims for your hair can help prevent future damage and minimize or restore existing damage. Take the time to maintain your hair's health by trimming it regularly, usually every 6 to 8 weeks.",

         "How to Dry Hydrangeas",
         "There are approximately 23 varieties of hydrangeas, which yield a diverse range of colors in shades of white, pink, blue, and lilac. Whether your flowers come from a florist or are grown in your garden, you can extend the beauty of your hydrangeas by drying them. This article provides instructions on how to dry hydrangeas using three different methods: silica gel drying, water drying, and pressing.\n1. **Select hydrangeas to dry.** To keep the color of most hydrangeas, it's best to start the drying process when the flowers first bloom. Cut or  buy fresh, recently opened hydrangeas on the morning you plan to start the drying process.\nPee Gee Hydrangeas however, look better when left to mature. Take these at different times of the season. They start out a pale green, then as they mature, some pink shows up, later turning to burgundy, and finally a chocolate brown color very late in late fall.\n\n\n\n\n2. **Prepare the flowers for drying.** Remove discolored parts and extra leaves, so the flowers are in good shape for drying. Cut the stems down to and or inch 2 (2.35 to 4.7 cm) from the base of the flowers.\n3. **Prepare the drying container.** Choose a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid to use for drying your flowers. Deeper containers work better than shallow ones, since the flowers will need to be completely submerged in silica gel.\n\nPour a thin layer of silica gel in the plastic container. The gel should completely cover the bottom of the container.\nErr on the side of pouring in too much gel to keep the flowers from being crushed against the bottom of the container.\n4. **Place the blooms in the container.** Take each bloom by the stem and carefully place it bloom-side down into the container. Add as many blooms as will comfortably fit in the container without touching each other or the container's sides.\n5. **Add more silica gel.** Place enough silica gel in the container to completely surround and support the hydrangeas.\n\nHold each flower steady with one hand and sprinkle the gel with the other until the flowers can stand up on their own and are covering the petals and stems. Fill the container with gel until it rises 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) above the blooms in addition to covering the stem.\nIf the container is narrow and very deep, you can suspend a flower at the bottom, cover it with silica gel, and add another bloom above it. Just make sure the container is deep enough that the flowers don't touch each other.\n6. **Start the drying process.** Put a lid on the container. Place it in a corner or a closet to allow the drying process to commence.\n\nWrite the date you submerged the flowers on the container, so you know when it's time to take them out.\nLeave container undisturbed for 4 days. Drying hydrangeas any longer in silica could result in brittle blooms that could shatter.\n7. **Remove the blooms from the container.** After 4 days, they should be completely dry.\n\nOpen the container and slowly pour the contents onto newspaper. Remove the dry hydrangea blooms and gently tap them to remove any loose silica.\nSave the silica gel in a plastic container for the next time you want to dry flowers.\n8. **Store or display the dried hydrangeas.** Carefully store the dried hydrangea blossoms in plastic bags until you're ready to use them or place them in a vase.\n9. **Prepare the flowers for drying.** Remove all but a few leaves, and discard discolored petals. Cut the flower stems to your desired length.\n10. **Fill a vase or container with a couple inches of water.** Place the flowers stem-side down into the vase, so the stems are submerged at the end of the stem.\n11. **Allow the flowers to dry.** Your hydrangea will slowly dry as the water gradually evaporates.\n\nPlace the vase out of direct sunlight, since strong sun can cause the flowers to shrivel or fade.\nDon't top off the water, since this may cause the flowers to mold before drying.\nThe drying process should take one to two weeks.\n12. **Remove the dried flowers.** Trim the stems if they are moist or discolored from being submerged in the water. Store the flowers in a plastic bag or place them in a vase and display.\n13. **Prepare the flowers for pressing.** Pressing flowers preserves the color and shape of the petals, but the shape of the hydrangea blossom itself will be flattened.\n\nCut the hydrangea blossoms in half to preserve and flatten their round shape.\nCut individual flowers and plan to arrange them in the shape of a hydrangea blossom after they're dried.\n14. **Prepare the press.** A press is made with two pieces of plywood that are tightened with screws and wing nuts. Remove the top piece of plywood and lay a piece of cardboard followed by two sheets of parchment or pressing paper on the bottom piece of plywood.\n\nThe cardboard and parchment paper should be cut a few inches smaller than the bottom of the press.\nThe bottom sheet of parchment paper is called the \"blotter.\" It absorbs moisture from the drying flower and is switched out every few days. The top sheet of parchment paper anchors the flowers during the drying process.\n15. **Lay the flowers on the top sheet of parchment paper.** Arrange them so that no petals or folded or crushed, unless you are trying to create a windblown effect.\n\nA little layering is fine, but don't build too many layers of petals, or they won't dry out correctly.\nIf you wish, add other foliage like leaves, ferns and other flowers.\n16. **Finish assembling the flower press.** Cover the flowers with a sheet of parchment paper, a second \"blotter\" sheet, a piece of cardboard, and the top piece of the flower press. Screw the plywood pieces together and tighten them with the wing nuts.\n17. **Allow the flowers to dry.** Set the press in a dry place in your home and let the drying process begin.\n\nOpen the press and change out the blotter sheets every few days. Discard the old sheets and replace them with fresh ones.\nAfter a week or two, the flowers should be completely dry. Remove them from the press.\n18. **Lift the pressed flowers from the parchment paper.** They are now ready to use in craft projects such as cards or jewelry. Pressed flowers also look beautiful mounted on a card and framed.",

         "How to Make Kitten Food",
         "Most cat food is specially formulated to take advantage of a cat's natural ability to metabolize protein better than carbohydrates along with other nutrients. Making your own cat food for your pet is possible, but can be very exacting and time consuming. The mixture needs to be accurate or you risk the cat becoming deficient in several key vitamins—leading to illness.\n1. **Purchase the main protein product.** You'll need either chicken, turkey, or rabbit. Commercially available products should be relatively safe for food preparation and the kitten's consumption.\n\nOne option is to use three pounds of poultry (chicken or turkey) thigh meat including the bones and skin. Another option is to purchase a mix of 2.25 lbs of a whole carcass ground rabbit plus 0.75 lbs of boneless chicken or turkey meat including the skin and fat.\nThis recipe will last 10-14 days for a cat eating 4-6 ounces per day.\n2. **Prepare one cup of water.** You may need to prepare more water if you cat needs more to drink. Have water set aside in separate cups for mixing and drinking.\n3. **Collect two eggs.** You will use the yolk raw, but lightly cook the egg white. Soft boiling the eggs is a good solution.\n4. **Buy 5,000 - 10,000 mg fish oil.** Fish oil can come in five to 10 capsules averaging 1,000 mg per capsule, and are a good source of fatty acids. Poke holes or cut off the tips of the capsules to pour out their contents into the water.\nAvoid using cod liver oil as this will be included in other ingredients.\n5. **Get vitamin additives.** You will need vitamins E, B-complex, and taurine (an amino acid) to further augment the food you are making. You'll need to get 400 IU (268 mg) of vitamin E. Also have on hand 50 mg of vitamin B-complex. Have 2,000 mg of taurine ready.\nVitamin E should be prepared preferably in powdered capsule form. Vitamin B-complex is best used in capsule or tablet form. Taurine should be added in loose powdered or capsule form.\n6. **Get some simple table salt.** You'll eventually use 1 teaspoon of table salt with some iodine for potassium and sodium boosts.\nAdd salt only if you are using poultry protein product and no rabbit.\n7. **Add a portion of chicken liver.** You'll need to add four ounces of chicken liver for every three pounds of poultry.\nThis is only to be done if you are not using rabbit protein which contains liver already.\n8. **Add a source of fiber.** Try guar gum at 1/16 teaspoon twice daily mixed into the food. You can fill 1/8 of a teaspoon halfway each time. This will help prevent constipation in the kitten.\n9. **Thaw the rabbit meat and mix in the ground and chunked poultry meat.** First, use a meat grinder or food processor to grind the poultry meat and skin. Next, combine the meat into a mixing bowl. Combine by hand and knead the meats together for a few minutes to make sure everything is thoroughly mixed.\n10. **Add the supplemental ingredients to the water.** Once they are all dissolved, add the vitamin mixture to the meat mixture.  Continue mixing the meat and supplements and then use knives to portion it off into other containers you can store in freezers.\n11. **Bake the poultry.** If you're using poultry only then putting your chicken or turkey product in the oven and cooking the liver will be necessary. Bake the poultry and liver at 350 degrees for approximately 15 minutes (time will vary). Remove the meat from the oven and pour on cold water to halt the cooking process.\n\nYou want the meats only half raw, though the liver will end up slightly more cooked than the poultry.\nSave the fat drippings as additives to the ground meat.\n12. **Cut the poultry and liver into chunks about the size of a die (half-inch cubes or larger).** You can use knives or scissors. Put the ground meats and fat into the refrigerator temporarily. This step is optional.\nUse a meat grinder for the more meaty bones and any meat not chunked. Include the liver and eggs.\n13. **Mix up the supplemental ingredients including vitamins into the water.** Pour the supplement mix into the meat mixture. Make sure the meat and supplements are mixed well then portion them out into containers and put them into the freezer. Leave 3/4\" of space for the food to expand.\n14. **Use the refrigerator for defrosting.** You'll need to move the frozen portions to the refrigerator a couple of days ahead of use. The new kitten food you made should be in the refrigerator for approximately 48 to 72 hours in a defrosted state.\n\nConsider using large plastic containers on the order of 1 - 1.5 pounds in capacity. Adjust for the number of kittens and other cats you have.\nIf you want to warm up the food then apply some hot tap water or heating in the microwave for 10-15 seconds.\n15. **Purchase 3 pounds of raw muscle meat.** This should ideally be some kind of poultry or rabbit. Get chicken thighs and/or drumstick meat. Rabbit also can work. Leave approximately half the skin.\n16. **Get 14 ounces of raw heart.** If you cannot get heart then you can use a supplement of 4,000 mg of taurine powder or capsules. You will also need to substitute the amount of meat to the total of raw muscle meat. In other words add 14 ounces of raw meat.\nThe heart can be chicken heart\n17. **Acquire 7 ounces of raw liver.** The best kind of liver in this case would be chicken liver. Alternatives to chicken liver would be vitamin A and D supplements. You need to add 40,000 IU of vitamin A and 1600 IU of vitamin D. You will also need to add 7 ounces to the raw muscle meat total.\n18. **Prepare 16 ounces (2 cups) of water.** You will need this for mixing. Have additional water prepared for drinking in separate containers if your kitten needs more water with the meal.\n19. **Prepare 3.08 tablespoons (9.25 teaspoons) of bone meal.** Make sure this is the variety meant for human consumption. This is an important calcium source in cat food and essential for your kitten's growth.\n20. **Ready 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin and 4 raw egg yolks.** This will be part of the supplement slurry later. Select eggs that are from free-range, antibiotic-free chickens preferably.\n21. **Buy supplements.** You will need several other vitamin and nutritional supplements to add to the food mix. You need to get 4 capsules of raw glandular supplement such as the multi-gland supplement by Immoplex. Get 4,000 mg of salmon. Buy 800 IU vitamin E. Have 200 mg of vitamin B-50 complex. Have 1.5 teaspoon of Morton Lite salt (with iodine).\nThe salmon oil, B-50, and vitamin E should be in capsule form. You don't need the Morton Lite salt with iodine if you are using rabbit meat.\n22. **Remove half of the skin from the meat.** Do this for all the poultry but not the rabbit. Use a peeler or your hands to remove the skin.\n23. **Cut the raw muscle meat into chunks.** Have several knives or scissors ready to go. Cut the poultry or rabbit into chunks the size of dice or slightly larger than half-inch cubes. Save the chunked pieces. Do not grind them. You can cut off the skin if its poultry, but leave on the skin if you are cutting up rabbit.\n24. **Grind the liver, non-chunked meat, and heart.** You'll need this for mixing later. Combine these meats thoroughly and store them temporarily in a refrigerator. Use a meat grinder or processor to grind and combine the meats.\n25. **Prepare the supplement solution.** Fill a bowl with 2 cups of water. Mix in all of the supplements except the gelatin. If you had extra vitamins to replace the heart and/or liver put them into the water at this time. Whisk the mixture briefly and add the gelatin at the end. Stir well.\n26. **Mix all three batches.** Retrieve the refrigerated meat mixture for this step. Combine the supplement mix into the recently refrigerated meat combination, and then add in the chunked meat cut earlier. Mix these thoroughly. Portion out the final mixture into containers and put them in the freezer.\n27. **Set up your freezer containers correctly.** Leave enough space for the food to expand. Use the refrigerator for defrosting for a couple of days before use.\nThis recipe makes 4.4 pounds (2 kg) of food which can last 12-14 days for the average cat.",

         "How to Adjust an Impact Sprinkler",
         "Impact sprinkler heads sit on a rotating bearing, which allows them to pivot as water flows through them for full 360 degree coverage. If you want to tweak your impact sprinkler system to change the pressure, spray pattern, or arc of the water, there are several ways you can go about it. The simplest solution is to control the flow of water at its source. You can also adjust the different parts of the head, like the diffuser pin, movement collars, and deflector shield, to get just the right strength and trajectory.\n1. **Adjust the flow of water at the source.** The simplest way to change the amount of water coming out of your impact sprinkler is to tighten (clockwise) or loosen (counterclockwise) the hose faucet where it’s hooked up. Opening the faucet to increase the water flow will increase the power and coverage of the stream, while decreasing the flow will confine the sprinkler coverage to a smaller area. \nUse a lower water flow when you want to avoid damaging delicate plants, like flowers and leafy shrubs, with a forceful blast.\n2. **Change the position of the diffuser pin.** The diffuser pin is a large screw anchored to the base of the sprinkler head. If you want to decrease the distance that your sprinkler covers, screw the pin in a clockwise direction until it sits over the water nozzle. For a more concentrated stream that will go further, unscrew the pin all the way or remove it entirely.\n\nWhen inserted, the diffuser pin breaks up the stream, causing it to fan out in a delicate spray or mist.\n\nThe further the pin projects over the opening, the shorter and wider the spray will be.\n3. **Raise or lower the deflector shield.** Swivel the flat metal square attached to the body of the sprayer head (just beside the diffuser pin) up or down. When the stream hits the downturned deflector shield, it will be redirected into a lower arc perfect for watering nearby plants and patches of grass. \nIf you’re trying to water from one end of your lawn or garden to the other, keep the deflector shield up. This will allow the stream to travel in a higher arc and cover longer distances.\n4. **Use the friction collars to alter the spray pattern.** Twist the metal clamps that wind around the base of the sprinkler head into different positions to determine the movement of the sprinkler head. The closer together the collars are, the narrower the watering range.\n\nAs the sprinkler turns, the wiry metal piece at the base of the head, known as the trip pin, will run up against the collar clamps, causing the sprinkler to reverse direction.\nMake sure the trip pin stays within the range you want to set for the sprinkler. That way you can water the rose bushes outside your home without dousing the front porch or the garage door.\n5. **Flip up the trip pin for full 360 degree coverage.** If you want the sprinkler to rotate all the way around, simply lift the trip pin until it rests up against the sprinkler head. It will then be able to send out water in a smooth, radial motion. \nGetting the trip pin out of the way can be helpful if your sprinkler system is located in the center of the area you’re watering.\n6. **Adjust the distance control dial.** Some impact sprinkler models feature a separate dial that allows users to manually set the desired spray distance. If your sprinkler has one of these dials, turning it to the left will reduce the force of the stream, while turning it the right will pressurize it to send it further.\n\nThe approximate distances should be clearly labeled in feet or meters, making it easy to get just the right coverage.\nAssuming your impact sprinkler doesn’t have a distance control dial, you’ll get the best custom spray by tinkering with the water pressure, diffuser pin, and deflector shield.\n7. **Make sure you're using a water source with a pressure of at least 15 psi.** Lower water pressures won’t have the force needed to make an impact sprinkler system effective. If your sprinklers are falling short or don’t seem to be putting out water at a very high rate, you may be better off with a different method of irrigation.\n\nYou can find out how many psi’s you’re working with by calling your local water provider or using a pressure gauge that fits over the end of a standard garden hose.\nMost residential areas have an average water pressure somewhere between 40-60 psi. However, yours might be lower if you get your water from a pump or well.\n8. **Choose the right sprinkler head.** Impact sprinkler heads are usually sold in a couple different materials—plastic and metal. Plastic heads are lightweight, making them easier to turn with a conservative water flow of around 20-40 psi. While they tend to be slightly more expensive, metal heads will be better able to handle the strain of higher pressures.\n\nMetal sprinkler heads are also more durable, meaning they’ll last longer and experience fewer issues.\n\nIf you’re unsure which type of head will work best for your home, consult with a home improvement or gardening expert while you’re shopping for an impact sprinkler system.\n9. **Clean your sprinkler periodically.** A new sprinkler that has stopped performing to its usual standard may just be in need of a good cleaning. Remove the sprinkler head from the base and disassemble it to gain access to the nozzle and swivel bearing. Gently scrub each piece with hot water and a bottle brush to remove any debris or mineral buildup that may be inhibiting the sprinkler’s movement.\n\nCommon symptoms of a dirty sprinkler include a weak stream with normal water pressure, turning to one side and stopping, and failing to rotate at all.\nA mixture of vinegar and warm water can cut through heavy mineral and sediment deposits that have accumulated inside the sprinkler head.",

         "How to Bleed Power Steering",
         "You may end up with air in your power steering lines if you were working on your vehicle, replacing a part, or you have a minor leak in the power steering lines. If air does find its way inside of the power steering assembly, you may hear a growling noise when you drive and the steering wheel may be slightly harder to turn than it normally is. Bleeding the power steering is a simple way to force trapped air out of your power steering pump and hydraulic lines. Keep in mind, if you bleed the power steering and the problem returns in a few months, you probably have a leak. If you do, have a mechanic take a look at your vehicle to diagnose and repair the problem.\n1. **Locate the power steering reservoir and twist the cap off.** Read your vehicle’s manual to find your power steering reservoir, which is where the power steering fluid is stored. The location of this tank varies from vehicle to vehicle, but it’s usually next to the coolant reservoir on the passenger side of the engine bay. Look for a small, cylindrical compartment that looks roughly half the size of the coolant reservoir and has a removable plastic cap on top. With the vehicle off, twist the cap off of the power steering reservoir by twisting it counterclockwise.\n\nIt will usually say “power steering” on top of the plastic cap. It may also list the type of power steering fluid you need on the cap.\n\nThis is one of those automotive repairs that basically anyone can do, especially since you don’t need to remove or disassemble anything. This is a great way to save a few dollars by skipping a trip to the mechanic!\n2. **Fill the power steering reservoir to the cold fill line if the fluid is low.** You can determine what type of power steering fluid you need by reading your instruction manual. It is usually printed on the reservoir cap as well. Inspect the dipstick attached to the bottom of the cap. There are two hash marks: cold, and hot. If the liquid is lower than the “cold” hash mark, slide a funnel into the reservoir’s opening and pour in enough power steering fluid to reach the “cold” hash mark on the dipstick.\n\nMost vehicles use Dextron, Pentosin, or synthetic hydraulic fluid. You can purchase power steering fluid at any automotive store.\n\nIf your reservoir doesn’t have a dipstick, there’s a fill line on the inside or outside of the reservoir. You may need to use a flashlight to look inside the tank and look for the fill line.\n3. **Close the cap to keep fluid from popping out while you bleed the system.** Bleeding the power steering lines forces air out of the system. This can cause power steering fluid to spill out of the reservoir as the pressure in the power steering lines increases. To avoid making a mess, put the cap back on your power steering reservoir and close it tight.\nOnce your vehicle is off of the ground, you can slide a drip pan under the reservoir just to be safe. This is probably unnecessary, but it’s a good idea if you want to keep steering fluid off of the ground.\n4. **Bleed the system using a vacuum pump kit if your car has a bleed valve.** Read your vehicle’s manual to see if your power steering has a bleed valve. If it does, purchase a vacuum pump kit for a power steering system and slide the end of the vacuum pump’s hose over the bleed valve. Then, pull the trigger on the vacuum until the gauge on the pump reads 20 Hg (inches of mercury). This will pull any excess air out of the system.\n\nA small percentage of vehicles have bleed valves on the power steering assembly. Most vehicles don’t come with one because it’s fairly easy to bleed the power steering without a vacuum kit.\nYou can buy a reservoir cap with a bleed valve adaptor on the lid if you want to use a vacuum kit to pump your power steering lines but you don’t have a built-in bleed valve. You can also buy a vacuum kit with an adaptor that slides directly into the opening of the reservoir if you don’t want to buy a new cap.\n\nYou can still bleed your power steering using the traditional method if you have a bleed valve. This is just an option you have if your vehicle comes with a bleed valve. It’s easier to do it this way since you don’t need to elevate the vehicle and it takes less than 5 minutes.\nYou don’t need to open or close anything to insert the hose into the bleed valve. The hose just slides right on.\n5. **Lift your vehicle off of the ground with jack stands.** With your vehicle on a flat surface, slide wedges or chocks behind your back tires to keep the vehicle from sliding back. Slide a hydraulic floor jack under one side of your vehicle. Step repeatedly on the hydraulic jack’s pedal to raise the side of your vehicle up. Then, slide a jack stand under the side of the vehicle so it rests on the frame. Repeat this process on the other side to lift your front wheels entirely off of the ground.\n\nIf you can, use the smallest jack stands available to you. You only need the tires to be slightly off the ground, and it’ll be easier and safer to get in and out of the vehicle if you don’t have to climb up to get in the driver’s seat.\nYou don’t need to raise the back. Bleeding the power steering involves turning the steering wheel back and forth over and over again. You only need the front wheels off of the ground.\nIf you don’t have jack stands, you can still do this with your vehicle on the ground. You may not completely bleed the power steering lines, but you should still see a noticeable improvement if there is air trapped in the system.\n6. **Put the key in the ignition to unlock the steering wheel.** Carefully get in the vehicle, or open the door and reach over to the ignition. Insert the key in the ignition, but don’t turn the vehicle on. You need to turn the steering wheel while the vehicle is off, but you can’t do this if the key isn’t in the ignition.\nOn some vehicles, you’ll need to turn the key to the accessory position by turning it halfway or backward to unlock the steering wheel. It all depends on your make and model.\n7. **Turn the steering wheel lock to lock by turning it left and right.** Grab your steering wheel and turn it all the way to the left like you’re making an extreme left turn. Once the wheels rotate as far as they can to the left, turn the steering wheel all the way to the right. This is known as turning the steering wheel from lock to lock, and this process forces air out of your power steering pump and lines.\nTurning your steering wheel engages the power steering and forces the fluid to cycle through the lines. If there is air trapped in your power steering lines, this pressure forces the air out to the top of the reservoir.\n8. **Keep turning the steering wheel 20 or 35 more times to push the air out.** Continue turning the steering wheel back and forth. Go all the way to the left, then all the way to the right. If you drive a standard car, do this at least 20 times to force all of the air out. Do this 35 times if you drive an SUV, truck, or minivan.\n9. **Check the power steering level after turning the wheel and fill as needed.** Get out of the vehicle carefully and walk back over to the power steering reservoir. Open the cap on your reservoir and check the power steering fluid to see if it is lower than it was when you first checked it. If it is low, fill the power steering reservoir up with more power steering fluid so that the liquid reaches the “cold” fill line on the dipstick.\n\nThe power steering fluid levels typically go down when you remove the air. The excess air sits in the power steering lines and pushes the fluid up to make it seem like there is more fluid in the power steering lines than there actually is. Removing this air will cause the fluid levels to drop back down.\nYou may hear a small popping sound when you open the cap. This is because all of the air was forced to the top of the reservoir when you were turning lock to lock.\n10. **Start the vehicle and turn the steering wheel lock to lock 20 or 35 times.** Close the cap on the power steering reservoir and get back in the vehicle. Start your vehicle. Then, turn the wheel lock to lock again by turning the wheel all the way to the left, then all the way to the right. If you drive a standard car, do this an additional 20 times to let the power steering fluid cycle through the lines again. If you have an SUV, truck, or minivan, do this 35 times.\nIf you notice the steering is smoother while you’re doing this, congratulations! You likely removed all of the air and you’re about to be done.\n11. **Inspect the top of the power steering reservoir for bubbles.** Turn the engine off and get out of the vehicle again. Go to your power steering reservoir and open the cap. If you see the fluid at the top of the reservoir bubbling, it means there is still some air in your power steering lines. If there is no bubbling, the air is gone and you’re done!\nIf all of the air is gone and there is no more bubbling, close the cap on your power steering reservoir and take your jack stands off.\n12. **Continue turning the steering wheel until the fluid is bubble-free.** If you saw bubbling in the power steering reservoir, close the cap and get back in the vehicle. Turn the engine on and turn it lock to lock an additional 20-30 times. Continue repeating this process until you no longer see bubbles appearing at the top of the power steering reservoir.\nWhen you’re done, tighten the cap on the reservoir and take your vehicle off of the jack stands.",

         "How to Choose a Yorkie Puppy",
         "Yorkshire Terriers are a fun-loving, independent breed of dog. They were originally bred in Yorkshire England in the 19th century to catch rats in England’s clothing mills. They make great pets, but they also take a lot of responsibility. If you’re thinking of welcoming a Yorkie into your home, make sure that you're ready for the responsibility and can make an informed decision about which puppy you bring into your family.\n1. **Consider whether you are ready to make a time commitment to a new puppy.** The average Yorkshire terrier can live anywhere from 12 to 16 years. This dog will be in your life for a long time, so don’t get a puppy if you’re not prepared to make a long-term commitment. Furthermore, dogs who don’t get enough care and attention on a day-to-day basis often develop behavior problems like excessive barking, chewing, and digging in the yard. While Yorkies don’t need as much exercise as other breeds might, they do need a lot of attention and love.\nIf you don’t have the time to give your pet all the attention it needs to be happy and well-adjusted, wait until you’re ready to bring a dog into your family.\n2. **Calculate whether you can afford a dog.** When you get a Yorkie, you’ll have to pay more than just the one-time purchase price. All dogs have ongoing needs throughout their life, including good quality food, toys, grooming, licensing fees, and routine medical checkups. You’ll also spend a lot of money during the first year on a crate, a carrier bag, training sessions, spaying/neutering, vaccinations, etc. The ASPCA estimates that in the first year, small dog owners will spend about $1,314 on their new pet, then $580 yearly after that.\n3. **Decide whether a Yorkie is the right breed for you.** There's a great deal of variation in size, temperament, and needs from breed to breed. Even if you love all dogs, you should think carefully about whether a specific breed will be a good fit for you and your family. Yorkshire terriers have many positive traits:\n\nThey are a \"Toy\" breed, meaning they are small lap dogs that won't hog the couch or be able to overpower you when they get excited.\nThey're highly adaptable, and do well in large homes and apartments alike.\nThough each dog will have its own personality, in general, Yorkies are cat-friendly.\nYorkies are a highly intelligent breed, and take well to training.\nThey're incredibly affectionate companions who love to be around their families.\n4. **Be aware of the drawbacks of the breed.** Though there’s a lot to recommend the Yorkies, all breeds have drawbacks that might make them a bad fit for a particular household. Some things you should know about Yorkshire terriers before bringing one home include:\n\nThese are territorial dogs who bark a lot. While this makes for a good watchdog, early training to curb excessive barking is important for a happy household.\nThough they love to relax and cuddle, Yorkies are very high energy and love to dash about the house.\nTheir long coats mean owners must make a commitment to regular grooming and be willing to deal with shedding fur.\nThey may be affectionate, but Yorkies can also be a bit snappy at times.\nThis, combined with their small size, might make them a bad fit for families with small children in the house.\nAll purebred breeds have health concerns. The Yorkie's include knee problems, collapsing trachea, dental issues, hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.\n5. **Choose your ideal Yorkie size.** There are no official variations in Yorkie sizes according to the American Kennel Club (AKC). A healthy adult should weight between 4 and 7 pounds. That said, \"teacup\" Yorkies — though not an official breed — are dogs that have been bred specifically for their small size. They may weight 1-3 pounds when grown. The size of the grown dog can only be estimated at birth, so there's no guarantee that your \"teacup\" Yorkie won't grow to be 5 pounds in adulthood.\nNote that breeding for the \"teacup\" size is often done at the expense of the dogs' health. You may have to deal with higher medical expenses with the smaller dogs.\n6. **Decide what kind of source you want to get your Yorkie from.** You have three options for locating a Yorkshire terrier puppy: breeders, breed rescues, and general animal shelters. Each of these sources has its own pros and cons:\n\nBreeders: a breeder can provide the dog's lineage if a strong pedigree is important to you. However, breeders can be expensive, and unethical breeders might not provide the best care for your puppy in its earliest days. A bad breeder may also breed unhealthy dogs.\nBreed rescues: look for Yorkie-specific rescue centers in your area. These animals need good homes, so if you want to save an animal, a breed rescue is a good option. However, you will not have access to the dog's pedigree, and many dogs might be mixed-breed. You may also find more adults than puppies.\nGeneral animal shelter: it will be hard to find a purebred Yorkie in a general animal shelter, and you’ll likely find more adults than puppies. However, if the shelter’s a kill shelter, you might save your dog’s life. Furthermore, shelters are usually far cheaper than breeders or breed rescues.\n7. **Contact breed rescues and shelters in your area.** Many rescues and shelters have websites that are updated regularly with the new dogs available for adoption. Keep an eye on these websites for the puppy you want to rescue.\nIf you don’t see a suitable puppy on the websites, call the rescues and shelters to see if you can be put on a notification list. They may be willing to call you if a Yorkie puppy comes into their care.\n8. **Question breeders in your area over the phone.** If you choose to buy your puppy from a breeder, you should conduct a thorough investigation into how ethical the breeder is. There is no license for breeding — anyone with a litter of puppies can call him- or herself a breeder. You want to make sure you only buy a puppy from someone who takes the responsibility of breeding animals seriously. A quality breeder will let you ask questions even if they don't have any puppies for sale. They may be able to refer you to someone who does have puppies at the moment.\n\nAsk the breeders how long they’ve been breeding Yorkies, and whether they’ve seen any health issues in the dogs they’ve bred.\nDon't limit your questions you have for the breeder. You want to make sure your puppy comes from a responsible place.\nDo their dogs have a good pedigree, and will the breeder provide pedigree papers to ensure the puppy doesn’t come from an inbred line?\nDo they dock, or cut off, their puppies' tails? Docking is an unnecessary cosmetic procedure that’s illegal in some countries. This is a form of mutilation, and that breeder should not be encouraged in any way.\nIf you want to raise Yorkies yourself, ask if the breeder requires you to spay/neuter their puppies.\nDo they have a return policy, in case your situation changes or you discover a health issue in your dog?\nHave they already begun the litter’s vaccination program? What shots have they had, and what will you have to get them?\n9. **Visit each breeder who seems like a good fit.** A breeder can say whatever they’d like over the phone, but you should visit your top choices in person to see for yourself that they are trustworthy operations. A good breeder will socialize puppies from a young age so they trust humans. Though some puppies might be shyer than others, in general the litter should be comfortable around people. Ask to see the whole litter with its mother to make sure the family is kept together and happy, and that the puppies weren’t weaned too early.\n\nMake sure the facilities are clean, and that each dog has comfortable living quarters with its own food and water bowl.\nYou should not see more than 1 or 2 Yorkies crowded into a single kennel.\nCheck that the dog areas are tidy and free of feces or urine. A good breeder will clean their kennels daily.\nIf the operation seems unprofessional or questionable, cross that breeder off your list.\n10. **Do not support puppy mills.** Puppy mills breed and sell large numbers of dogs for a profit. Because they are more interested in money than the quality of the dogs’ lives, they do not provide adequate care for the animals in their care. Puppies from mills often come home with giardia, parvovirus, and other diseases that would be addressed by a proper breeder. They often overbreed and inbreed their dogs, resulting in genetic health conditions that will reveal themselves as the puppy grows up. Because puppy mill breeders don’t spend time with their animals, mill puppies are often unsocialized, and even fearful of humans.\nPuppy mills are inhumane. Do not, under any circumstances, support a breeder who treats his or her animals improperly.\n11. **Visit with all the puppies in a litter.** To find the right Yorkie, you need to see how they act with their siblings. Check the puppies for shyness. If 4 out of 5 puppies run away or act afraid of you, they may have a genetic predisposition for shyness. Odds are the 1 brave puppy has the same genetic coding, so you should look for the perfect Yorkshire Terrier in another litter or with another breeder.\n\nWatch the puppies play with each other. Normal puppies are curious, friendly, and like to play.\nLook for warning signs: is the puppy anxious? Fearful? Aggressive?\n12. **Assess each puppy’s health.** Ask the breeder if you can spend some time with each of the available puppies individually. To find the right Yorkie, you need to make sure the puppy is healthy and evaluate how they act when not surrounded by their siblings.\n\nInspect the puppy's fur, eyes, rear end and ears. A healthy Yorkshire Terrier puppy will have clear eyes, a clear nose, a shiny coat, and clean ears. An ill puppy may have a matted or shabby coat, discharge, a cough, a potbelly, and dirty ears.\nTest the puppies' hearing. Make a loud noise and see if the puppy reacts. A puppy with good hearing will react right away and then become curious about what caused the sound.\n13. **Ask about the litter’s medical history to this point.** Puppies require frequent vet visits for vaccinations and checkups in their early months. Have the puppies already been treated for heartworm and parasites or been given their vaccinations? If not, you will have to pay for all of those procedures out of pocket.\n14. **Choose your puppy.** Remember that you are choosing a Yorkie puppy, the puppy is not choosing you. If you select the puppy that runs right up and jumps all over you, you may end up with the most energetic puppy in the litter, and have regrets later on. Choose the puppy that has the best personality and is not too bossy nor too timid. A Yorkie with a good nature will wag its tail, not bully its siblings, and not growl or bite.\nDo not choose a puppy that has any behavioral or health concerns.",

         "How to Preserve Guava",
         "Guava is a delicious and nutritious snack that has many health benefits and a unique taste. However, it's a tropical fruit that tends to go bad quickly after ripening. To prolong the life of your guava, you can refrigerate or freeze it once it's ripe!\n1. **Leave the guava on the counter to ripen if they're still firm.** Your guavas should be soft to the touch and have a strong, heady scent before you refrigerate them. If the guavas aren't ripe yet, let them sit on the counter for 2-3 days until the skin yields when you press on the fruit.\n\nAvoid placing guava near a window because the heat and light can make it ripen too quickly.\nIf the guava is taking a long time to ripen, try placing it in a paper bag with the top slightly open.\n2. **Put the ripe guava in a plastic or paper bag.** Before you refrigerate the guava, place the entire fruit in a bag to protect it in the refrigerator. Other fruits can give off gasses that encourage ripening, and the bag will ensure that the guava is safe.\n\nMake sure the bag is clean and dry before putting the guava in it. Dirt and water can cause the guava to ripen further in the refrigerator.\nRemember to label the bag with the date for future reference.\n3. **Place the bag in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator.** Be sure to set the crisper drawer to a medium humidity to ensure that the guava doesn't become too dry or too moist. Leave the bag open slightly at the top to let air circulate through the bag and the drawer.\nIf possible, store the guava in a separate drawer from other fruits such as apples or oranges, which can cause the guava to go bad quickly.\n4. **Use or eat the guava within 3-4 days of refrigerating.** Refrigeration will slightly prolong the life of the guava, but be sure to use it in a timely manner. After 4 days in the refrigerator, the guava will be past ripe and should be thrown away.\nIf you can't tell how ripe your guava is, press on the skin to feel if the fruit is very soft. Over-ripe guava will dent when you press on it.\n5. **Wash and peel the skin off of the guava.** Rinse the guava under cool water and blot the fruit dry with a paper towel. Then, use a knife or peeler to carefully remove all of the skin from each guava. You can dispose of the skin, or you can place it in a compost pile with other food scraps.\nBe careful when using the peeler on the guava. The small, rounded shape can cause the peeler to slip.\n6. **Cut the guava in half with a sharp knife.** On a cutting board, slice the guava in half through the widest part in the middle of the fruit. You can cut the halves again to make chunks, or leave them in halves to freeze.\nThis will help the sugar in the simple syrup to permeate into the fruit and keep it tasting sweet after the freezing process.\n7. **Place the halves in an airtight container or bag.** Once the guava is cut, get a freezer bag or airtight container with a lid. Make sure it's large enough to fit all of the fruit with about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of empty space at the top of the container, called headspace.\nThe headspace will allow for quicker freezing time, which keeps the guava fresh for a longer period in the freezer.\n8. **Pour simple syrup over the guava to preserve the taste of the fruit.** Simple syrup is a mixture of equal parts water and sugar that is heated to a boil to create a sweet syrup. Pour the cooled syrup into the container or bag until the guavas are completely submerged, but remember to leave enough headspace in the container.\nIf you've just made the simple syrup, let it cool before pouring it over the fruit. Warm syrup can cook the guava, causing a change in taste.\n9. **Seal the container and place it in the freezer.** Make sure the lid of the container is closed tightly or the bag is completely sealed. Label the container or bag with the date and let it sit in the freezer undisturbed for at least 12 hours before thawing.\nIf you're going to freeze the guavas for a long period of time, avoid placing them in the door of the freezer. The door experiences more temperature changes than the rest of the freezer, which can cause thawing.\n10. **Use the guava within 1 year of freezing.** While guava can last in the freezer for long periods of time, the taste of the fruit will deteriorate after a year. When you're ready to use it, place the guava in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours to thaw before taking it out of the container.\nIf you're not sure how to use your frozen guava, you can try making juice, baking guava-based pastries, or even whipping up a guava barbecue sauce!",

         "A Roku is a TV, HDMI stick or video player that streams content by connecting to the Internet via WiFi or Internet router. After you've plugged in the Roku device, connected to your wireless network and selected the channels you want to watch, you can begin to stream content immediately. Once you're finished using your Roku, you may want to turn it off, put it into Standby Mode, or even completely restart it.\n1. **Know that all Roku devices have no on/off switch because they're designed to run constantly to download updates.** But some ROKU voice remotes can be able to control the TV's power. So whether you have a Roku Streaming Player, Roku TV or Roku Streaming Stick, the only way to totally turn off your Roku is to unplug the device completely.\n2. **Turn off the Roku Streaming Player by unplugging it from your viewing device.** If you plugged the Roku Streaming Player into your TV with an AV cord, then unplug it from the television; if you used an HDMI cord, then unplug that from the HDMI port. After this is done, unplug the A/C power adapter from the Roku Player. This will completely turn it off.\n3. **Turn off the Roku Streaming Stick by unplugging it from the HDMI port on the television.** If your TV provides power through the HDMI port, then all you should have to do is remove the stick, and then your Roku will be turned off.\nIf your HDMI port does not provide power, you would have needed to connect a micro-USB cable adapter to the Roku Stick and have plugged it into a wall outlet.\nNo matter what the case, as long as you remove the Roku Streaming Stick directly from the HDMI port, the Roku will shut off completely, learn more at: http://www.manualslib.com/manual/696105/Roku-Streaming-Stick.html.\n4. **Turn off the Roku TV by unplugging the TV from the wall.** When you use the Roku remote to \"turn off\" your Roku TV, you're actually just putting the television into Standby mode. The only way to completely turn off the Roku TV is to unplug the cord from the outlet. Once this is done, the TV should be completely off.\n5. **Restart Roku by unplugging the device and plugging it back in.** You may want to restart your Roku if it's not working correctly. After you do this, the screen should scroll up and then go completely blank. The Roku should then start back up; this will signify a successful restart.\n6. **Alternately, restart Roku by using the Roku remote.** To do this, hold the remote, press the Home button five times in a row, press the Up arrow once and press the Rewind button two times. Then, press the Fast Forward button two times.\n7. **As another alternative, restart Roku from the main menu.** If you've kept your Roku plugged in and updated with the latest software, you should have Roku 6.0. If you do, you have the version that allows you to restart the program from the main menu. To do this, go to Settings, System, and then System Restart. Select the System Restart button and your Roku should restart.\n8. **Whether you have a Roku TV, Streaming Stick or Player, you can put the Roku into Standby Mode by holding down the power button on your Roku remote.** If you should want to turn your Roku back on, hold down the power button again to continue using your Roku.\n9. **Know that if you don't use your Roku device for an extended period of time, it will go into Standby mode on its own to conserve energy.** If, for some reason, you can't manually make your Roku go into Standby mode, know that it will automatically go into Standby mode eventually.",

         "How to Cook Frog Legs",
         "Frog legs are a culinary delight growing in popularity. If you've never prepared this dish yourself, here's what you need to know about how to do it.\n1. **Cut the frogs' legs at the joint.** Use a pair of kitchen scissors to divide each frog leg in half at the knee joint.\nIf you do not have a pair of scissors set aside for kitchen use, you could use a sharp knife, instead. Just be careful to avoid cutting your fingers while trying to cut through the joint.\n2. **Marinate the legs in milk.** Place the frog legs in a bowl and pour the milk on top. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nDo not let the frog legs marinate at room temperature. The milk could spoil, and room temperature range is ideal for triggering bacterial growth in raw meat.\n3. **Season with salt and pepper.** After marinating the frog legs, let them drain on clean paper towels. Pat dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nIf you are not sure about how much salt and pepper to use, try using about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of each.\n4. **Dredge in flour.** Dump the flour onto a plate or shallow bowl. Place each frog leg in the flour and turn as needed to coat all sides.\n\nGently shake off excess flour when done.\nPlace the coated frog legs on a separate plate when done.\n5. **Heat 6 Tbsp (180 ml) butter in a large skillet.** Heat over high heat, letting it come to a sizzle.\nThe butter should begin to sizzle, but avoid letting it smoke. When butter becomes hot enough to produce smoke, it begins breaking down, which can affect the flavor of the end dish.\n6. **Cook half the legs until golden brown.** Add half of the frog legs to the sizzling butter and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.\nFlip the legs over using tongs in the middle of the cooking process so that both sides are evenly cooked.\n7. **Repeat with more butter and the remaining frogs' legs.** Discard the remaining butter in the skillet and add a fresh 6 Tbsp (180 ml) more. Cook the remaining frog legs in the hot butter for 3 to 4 minutes.\nAs before, flip the legs over in the middle of the cooking process to cook both sides evenly.\n8. **Sauté the garlic.** Discard the butter currently in the skillet and add the remaining butter. Once it sizzles, add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute.\n\nStir the garlic continually to avoid burning it.\nWhen done, the garlic should be lightly browned and very fragrant.\n9. **Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper.** With the skillet off the heat, add the lemon juice and more salt and pepper. Stir to combine well.\nAs before, if you are not sure about how much salt and pepper to use, try using about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of each.\n10. **Serve frogs' legs with garlic sauce.** Place the frog legs in the center of a serving plate and drizzle the garlic sauce over or around them.\nGarnish with fresh parsley, if desired.\n11. **Prepare the frogs' legs.** Rinse the frog legs and pat dry with clean paper towels. Divide them at the joint using sharp kitchen scissors.\nIf you do not have a pair of scissors set aside for kitchen use, you could use a sharp knife, instead.\n12. **Combine the coating ingredients.** Place the crushed crackers, flour, cornmeal, dried minced onion, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Zip the back up and shake vigorously to combine the ingredients together.\nMake sure that the bag is large enough to fit the coating ingredients as well as one or two frog leg pieces at a time.\n13. **Combine the eggs and milk.** Whisk the eggs and milk together in a small bowl until thoroughly mixed.\nThe mixture should be a consistent pale yellow color without any variations or streaks of white or darker yellow.\n14. **Heat the oils in a large, heavy skillet.** Pour the vegetable oil and peanut oil into the skillet and heat them over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes.\n\nThe oil should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep.\nMake sure that the skillet you use is heavy and has high sides. If you do not have a large skillet with tall sides, you could use a saucepan, instead.\n15. **Coat the frogs' legs.** Dip each leg in the egg mixture. After letting the excess drip off, dredge each leg in the cracker mixture, turning to coat all sides.\nIf the bag with the cracker mixture is large enough, you can place a few pieces of frog leg in the bag at once, seal it, and shake lightly to coat them.\n16. **Fry the legs until golden brown on each side.** Transfer the frog legs into the hot oil, cooking each one for about 5 minutes per side.\n\nBe careful as you put the legs in the oil. The oil may sputter and spit at you if you get your hand too close or cause it to splash up by dropping the legs in with too much force.\nIf you notice that the legs are browning too fast, reduce the heat of the stove to medium from medium-high.\n17. **Drain and serve.** Use tongs to fish the cooked frog legs from the hot oil and transfer them to clean paper towels. Serve once the legs have drained for a minute or so.\n18. **Combine marinade ingredients.** Mix the vegetable oil, onion, parsley, salt, mustard, and basil in a small bowl. Also add the peel and juice of one lemon. Stir or whisk well to combine.\nPour 1/3 cup (80 ml) of the marinade into a small dish. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Set this portion aside for a later step.\n19. **Marinate the frog legs with some of the marinade.** Place the frog legs in a single layer inside a baking dish. Pour the remaining marinade over the legs and cover will plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator for 3 hours.\n\nThe frog legs must be in a single layer. Otherwise, they may not marinate evenly.\nUse tongs to occasionally turn the frog legs in the marinade as they sit in the refrigerator.\n20. **Preheat grill.** Brush the grill with additional vegetable oil and preheat it to medium heat.\n\nIf using a gas grill, preheat all the burners of the grill to a medium setting.\nIf using a charcoal grill, lay two layers or so of charcoal briquettes along the bottom of the grill. Light and let the flame burn away until a light layer of ash forms on the charcoal.\n21. **Grill frog legs for 6 to 7 minutes.** Drain the frog legs and transfer them to the hot grill. Cover the grill and cook for 3 minutes. Turn them over and close the grill again, cooking for another 3 to 4 minutes.\nThere should be no further traces of pink meat when the legs have finished cooking. Additionally, the meat should begin to separate from the bones will little effort once done.\n22. **Combine reserved marinade with butter and garlic.** Heat the reserved marinade with the butter and garlic in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the butter is melted, stirring often.\nThis should take about 1 or 2 minutes.\n23. **Serve frog legs with garlic sauce.** Transfer the frog legs to a serving plate and drizzle the butter mixture over or around them.\n24. **Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).** Meanwhile, grease a baking dish with nonstick cooking spray or shortening.\nAlternatively, you could line the bottom of the dish with aluminum foil or parchment paper. The important thing is simply to keep the meat from sticking to the bottom of the pan.\n25. **Combine the coating ingredients.** Mix together the Parmesan cheese, egg, butter, onion, garlic, cumin, rosemary, and tarragon in a small to medium mixing bowl until well combined.\nMake sure that the dish has a fairly wide mouth so that you will be able to easily dunk the frog legs in and out of it.\n26. **Coat the frogs' legs well.** Dip each frog leg in the cheese and egg mixture, coating both sides. Let the excess drip off before dredging all sides of each frog leg in bread crumbs.\nThe bread crumbs should be spread out on a wide plate or in a large bowl with shallow sides.\n27. **Transfer the frog legs to your prepared baking dish.** Spoon any remaining mixture over the frogs' legs once all have been coated and placed in the dish.\nThe frog legs should be spread out in an even, single layer. Do not stack the legs into multiple layers, since doing so could lead to uneven cooking.\n28. **Bake until golden brown.** Cook, uncovered, for about 1 hour in your preheated oven.\nYou should not need to stir or toss the frog legs as they cook, but if the top appears to be browning well before the end of the full cooking time, you can carefully reach in with a pair of tongs and turn the pieces over to expose the other side.\n29. **Serve hot.** Sprinkle with salt, to taste, and serve immediately.\n30. **Soak the frog legs in milk  while preparing the batter.** \n31. **Make the batter.** Whisk 2 eggs and 1 quarter cup of milk together. Add the and 2 tablespoons of CoffeeMate.\n32. **Dip the frog legs in the batter.** Roll in flour.\nFor a thicker coating, double dip in the batter.\n33. **Season to taste.** \n34. **Sauté or deep fry.** Serve immediately after frying.",

         "How to Get Rid of Ground Digger Wasps (Cicada Killers) from Your Lawn",
         "This article provides instructions on how to eradicate the ground-digger wasp (also known as the cicada-killer), should you have nest infestations on your lawn or property.\n1. **Learn about ground digger wasps.** Ground-digger wasps (GDWs) are very large (slightly larger than a green hornet) passive-aggressive wasps that \"build\" their nests in dry, unfertilized earth. They are typically large and black-bodied with yellow stripes on their back-end. When fully grown, they measure about one and a half inches (or more) in length with about a one and a quarter-inch wide wingspan.\n2. **Know the signs of ground digger wasps infesting your lawn or garden space.** You'll know you've got ground-digger wasp nests when you see small granular mounds of dirt piled up anywhere from two-to-five inches in height. At the base of the mound of granular dirt will be a finger-sized hole with a \"path\" of dirt leading out from it.\nThe nests will be sporadically built throughout your lawn or garden, but will typically be in the driest areas and/or under longer grass/weeds or under growing flowers. GDWs do not like, but can live in, moist soil.\n3. **Find out the local life cycle.** In the Northeast US, the life-cycle of a ground-digger wasp is about one month beginning in mid-July and ending around mid-to-late August (depending on where you live, their life-cycle may start earlier or later). They go from young adults buzzing about play-attacking with each other, to full-size adults in about two-to-three weeks.\n4. **It's important to understand that they only sting when attacked.** While very menacing looking, they are passive stingers, meaning only if very threatened will they attack and sting.  You'd practically have to start digging into their nests while they're flying about for one to come at you and sting you (so, don't do that!). Otherwise, they tend to buzz about to check you out and to scare you away and they probably will the first time you encounter them. Know that they'd rather get on with their business of killing cicadas up in the trees than sting you.\n5. **While the method suggested here basically kills the wasps in their nests, there is no other (safe- for-nearby-pets) way to eradicate them.** It is probable that you will still get nests from year-to-year, but only one, maybe two. The trick is to kill all of them while they're in their nests so their babies will not come back to the same place they were born.\n6. **Get the supplies.** To eradicate an infestation of ground-digger wasps (GDWs), purchase from your local party store and supermarket, the following items:  a) a large bag of white plastic knives, and b) up to three or four jug gallons of regular or lemon ammonia.\n7. **During the day, when the wasps are up hunting for cicadas in the trees, mark each nest you find with one of the plastic knives pushed into the ground as close to the hole of the nest as possible (without disturbing the hole).** Leave enough of the knife sticking out of the ground so you can see it.\n8. **After 10:30 or 11pm, (later is better), that evening, using a flashlight, seek out the knives you placed and carefully pour about two-to-three cups of ammonia into each of the holes.** At this time the wasps are probably nesting/sleeping, so you'll be catching them while in the nest. (You can stretch out the amount of ammonia by mixing a one-to-one ratio of water to ammonia. The diluted strength will still be enough to kill them.) Do not remove the knives.\n9. **The next day, repeat the process on any new nests that you find in the ground.** You'll know the new nests from the old ones because you'll still have the knives in place from the night before. Once you've identified the new nests, remove the old knives.You may have to continually repeat the process depending on the original amount of wasps. Or you could hit the wasps with tennis rackets, knocking them to the ground then step on them.\n10. **Try this option if you're happy to let nature's creatures follow their natural cycles without freaking.** First, this is a natural cycle and is part of nature's own way of dealing with a ballooning population of cicadas. Second, you can watch these interesting animals do their thing from the comfort of your own yard; they're raising their families just as every other natural creature tries to do.  The way to cope if you leave them alone is very simple:\n\nDo not aggravate them. Do not push or poke them, do not walk on them and do not attack them with anything.\nIgnore them for two months. Just let them be as they dig up cicadas to feed their children. After two months, they'll be off.\nDon't wander around with bare feet at night. Be sensible about walking in your garden; no yard is completely safe from prickles, stings and unpleasant things, so wear appropriate protection and practice sensible use of your yard.",

         "How to Make Lipstick Last All Day",
         "Lip color is the key to a great makeup look, but there's nothing more annoying than applying a great lipstick color only to have it fade within a few hours.  This article covers the best kinds of products to pick, as well as how to apply and maintain your lipstick so that it lasts throughout the day.\n1. **Select a matte formula.** Not all lipsticks are created equal. Makeup artists suggest that in order of longevity matte formulas have the most staying power, followed by cream formulas, then liquid lipsticks, with lip glosses coming in last.\n2. **Invest in a lip primer.** These are specially designed products that prime the lips for lipstick application and help the color adhere to the lips.  They are available from many different brands.\nSome makeup artists use concealer or foundation over the lips to similar effect. This has the added benefit of canceling out the natural color of your lips so that the true color of the lipstick shows up.\n3. **Outline your lips with reverse lip liner or concealer.** Reverse lip liner is a colorless product that can be applied to the skin just outside the outline of your lips to provide a barrier and prevent feathering around the edge of your lips. As an alternative, apply concealer in this same area to prevent bleeding and help your lipstick stay in place.\nFeathering occurs when the lipstick bleeds into the fine lines around the edge of your lips.  These fine lines get more pronounced as we age.\n4. **Get a lip brush for precise application.** The key to long-wearing lipstick is to apply several thin layers.  This is best achieved with a lip brush, which also allows for greater precision and control.\nA lip brush can help you apply the product neatly and precisely. It also ensures a more even distribution of product than when lipstick is applied right from the bullet.\n5. **Use several products together for a really long lasting effect.** Experts recommend using a lip primer and a lip liner with a lipstick on top or a liquid lip stain underneath a lipstick. Then as one layer wears off, the base layer remains intact. Make sure they are similar colors!\n6. **Prep your lips by gently exfoliating.** This will get rid of all the dead skin sitting on top of your lips that prevents the lipstick sinking in. It will also create a smooth, blank canvas for the lipstick to ensure even application.\n\nUse a lip scrub. Many brands offer these types of product.  You can also make your own with sugar, honey, and olive or coconut oil.\n\nGently scrub your lips with a soft toothbrush.  Don’t go too hard, you just want to remove loose dead skin.\nUse a damp washcloth on your lips, moving it in soft, circular motions to lift the dead skin.\n7. **Apply a hydrating lip balm.** This ensures that the lips are moisturized.  Applying lipstick to dry, cracked lips, especially a matte formula, can make lips look patchy and flaky.\n\nUse a balm with waxy consistency not a slippery or oily one which will cause the lipstick to move around.\n\nAllow some time for the lip balm to absorb before going on to the next step.  Make this the first step in your makeup routine and do the rest of your face while the balm is absorbing.\n\nThis can help your lips feel more comfortable, especially if you're not used to wearing matte lipstick.\n8. **Apply lip liner as a base.** Lip liner typically has a drier consistency than lipstick, so it serves as a layer for the lipstick to grip onto. Get a sharp cupid’s bow by drawing an x in the center of your top lip, then draw around the outline of your lips.  Use the point of the lip liner pencil for this. Then, use the pencil to fill in your whole lip.\n\nFilling in your whole lip is important because if the top layer of lip color wears off it won't reveal a sharp line. Use the side of the lip pencil to fill in the whole lip area.\n\nYou can also use a lip stain under your lipstick to help the color last longer.\n9. **Apply a thin layer of lipstick.** You can do this either straight from the tube or with a lip brush.\n10. **Blot the lipstick with a tissue.** Using a folded tissue, open your mouth and place it between your upper and lower lips, then press down on the tissue. This removes any excess product and keeps lipstick from transferring onto your teeth or clothing.\n11. **Apply a light dusting of powder to set.** Professional makeup artists use this trick to set the lipstick without moving any of the color.\n\nGet a tissue and separate the layers out.\nPlace just one thin sheet over your lips and apply loose, translucent powder with a big fluffy powder brush on top of the tissue.\nYou can apply powder directly to the lips to set if you don't have any tissues on hand, but be aware that overdoing it could result in a dry or discolored result.\n12. **Apply another thin layer of lipstick.** Repeat the previous steps of blotting and setting with powder.  This should give your lipstick real staying power.  Finally, you can use a setting spray if you have one.\n13. **Reapply after eating or drinking.** It is inevitable that your lip color will fade slightly over the course of the day. However, the change will be most noticeable when your lips come in direct contact with cups or utensils.\n\nBring your lipstick and apply another thin layer to top up the color after meals.\nCarry a compact mirror to check for smudging or movement.  Remember to check the lipstick hasn't transferred to your teeth.\n14. **Be careful when re-applying lip balm.** You may find your lips require hydration as the day goes on, especially with drier formulas such as mattes.  However, the oil in lip balm actually breaks up the color, causing it to wear off and fade.\n\nIf you find your lips get dry through the day, opt for a more moisturizing lipstick formula and make sure you don’t skip the crucial step of hydrating before application.\nAvoid licking your lips.  Not only will this make your lip color fade, it actually makes your lips drier over time.\nIf you do apply lip balm, allow it to absorb for a minute or two, blot any excess off with a tissue and then follow up with another layer of lipstick.  This gives your lips some much-needed moisture without the lip color fading.\nApply lip balm sparingly. Excessive use of lip balm can hinder your lips' natural ability to produce their own moisture.\n15. **Experiment with different products until you get one that works for you.** Once you have a solid grasp of the application technique you can begin to try different combinations to figure out which lipsticks offer the best longevity.",

         "How to Knit Small Flowers",
         "There are many ways to knit a flower, but knitting a small, simple flower is a good place to start. Choose your yarn and knitting needles and then use them to knit a small flower by following a simple pattern. Make a variety of different color flowers or many flowers in the same color! Give the flowers away as tokens of appreciation or sew them onto your knitting projects.\n1. **Choose a light to medium weight yarn and smaller needles.** To create small delicate flowers, choose a light to medium weight yarn and a pair of needles on the small end of the spectrum for that yarn. Usually, a US size 5 to 7 (3.75 to 4.5 mm) would be appropriate for a lightweight yarn and a 7 to 9 (4.5 to 5.5 mm) would be appropriate for a medium weight yarn, so choose a size at the lower end of the spectrum for the yarn you select.\nFor example, if you want to use a lightweight yarn for your flowers, then choose a US size 5 (3.75 mm) pair of knitting needles. If you want to use a medium weight yarn, then choose a US size 7 (4.5 mm) pair of knitting needles.\n2. **Make a slipknot** Loop the yarn around your index and middle finger twice. Then, pull the second loop through the first loop. Slide the loop onto your right hand knitting needle. Then, pull the tail of the yarn to tighten the loop.\n3. **Cast on** With the slipknot on your right hand needle, loop the yarn over the left hand needle and insert the needle through the loop. Then, pull this new loop through and let the other one fall off the right hand needle.\nContinue casting on stitches in this way until you have 50 total.\n4. **Purl** Transfer the needle with all of the stitches on it to your left hand and hold the empty needle in your right hand. Use the purl stitch to work all of the cast on stitches from the left needle to the right needle.\n5. **Knit** Hold the needle with all of the stitches on it to your left hand and the empty needle in your right hand.  Insert the right hand needle into the first stitch on the left hand needle. Then, yarn over the end of the left hand needle, use the right hand needle to pull this yarn through the stitch, and let the old stitch slide off.\n6. **Slip the stitch back onto the left hand needle.** Insert the left hand needle through the stitch that you just transferred to the right hand needle. Let the stitch slide off of the right hand needle and onto the left hand needle.\n7. **Loop the second stitch over the first.** Insert the empty right hand needle into the second stitch in the row. Then, pull it up and over the first stitch. Continue to loop the next 8 stitches up and over the first stitch in the row just as you did with the second stitch.\nThis is similar to binding off, except you will not be knitting after each loop over. The goal is to gather all 9 loops onto 1 loop.\n8. **Knit the last stitch but keep it on the needle.** After you loop the ninth stitch up and over the first 1, knit this stitch as you normally would, but do not let the old stitch slide off yet. Keep it on the needle.\n9. **Yarn over the needle and knit the same stitch again.** Loop the yarn over the needle in the front to create an extra stitch. Then, pull this yarn through the stitch and let the old 1 slide off the left hand needle as you do so.\nAt this point, you should have 3 stitches on the right hand needle.\n10. **Repeat this process all the way across the row.** Continue to knit 1, loop over 9, and then knit and increase for the rest of the row. When you reach the end of the row, you should have 15 stitches on your needle instead of 50 and the stitches should look scalloped or ruffled.\n11. **Turn your work and knit across the row.** Take the right hand needle with all of the stitches on it and transfer it to your left hand. Turn the work around as you do so. Then knit across the remaining stitches in this row.\nThe stitches will be in clumps of 3 and spread out across your needles. Keep the working yarn taut as you knit to begin gathering them.\n12. **Cut the working yarn and thread it onto a yarn needle.** Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the yarn about 10 inches (25 cm) from the last stitch. Then, insert the end of the working yarn through the eye of a yarn needle.\nYou can also use a tapestry needle to do this. Just make sure that the eye of the needle is large enough to fit your yarn through without damaging it.\n13. **Insert the threaded needle through the remaining loops.** Instead of knitting through the remaining loops on the needle, insert the threaded needle through each of the loops to secure them. Then, slide the loops off of the needle and pull on the end of the yarn. This will form a circle at the center of the petals.\nMake sure to pull the thread enough to bring both ends of the row together. The petals should be gathered around the circle.\n14. **Sew through the first stitch and first and last petals to secure the flower.** Once the circle is formed, sew through the first stitch at the center of the flower. Then, sew through the first and last petals to join them together. Tie off the yarn and cut the excess.\n\nYou may also weave in the end of the yarn if desired by sewing around the center of the circle a few times.\nThis completes your flower! Make more flowers in different colors for variety!",

         "How to Trade Binary Options",
         "Binary options trading has become increasingly popular over the last decade. Day traders in particular access these markets with ease from their computers. Another draw is that entrance requires relatively little capital. This article will delve into the basic rules of the game, how market exchanges work, and several ways to strategize for the greatest profit potential. Along the way, you'll also learn the jargon used in binary options trading that you need to understand to be successful.\n1. **Know the meaning of a binary option.** A binary option is based on a “yes” or “no” proposition to whether an underlying asset will be above a certain price at a specified time. If you answer yes and are correct at the time of expiry, you win and are “in the money.” If you answer no and lose, you lose the money you invested. You're “out of the money.”\n\nHowever, unlike other options, you can only make or lose up to $100 per options contract.\n\nAn underlying asset in binary options trading can be a specific company's stock; a commodity like gold; a stock index like the S&P 500 Index; Bitcoin; a Forex pairing, which is the value of one foreign currency against another; or a news event, such as whether the Federal Reserve will increase or decrease rates.\n\n\"In the money” and “out of the money” simply refer to whether you answered the proposition a) correctly and are “in the money” or b) incorrectly and are “out of the money.”\n\nThe expiry date is the time or date at which the binary option expires, and the price is examined to see if it increased or decreased. It can be anywhere from five minutes to over a month after you placed the trade.\n2. **Recognize it's an “all-or-nothing” deal.** Just like rolling the dice in a game of craps, you either win the pot or lose what you put in the pot. For example, if the proposition is, “Will the price of gold be above $1,150 by 1:30 p.m. today?” and you decide yes it will be, you would place a binary call option. If the option were trading at $35 (bid price) and $37.50 (ask price) at 1 p.m., you'd buy at $37.50. (If you were selling, you'd sell at $35.) If you're correct at 1:30 p.m. and the price of gold is above $1,150, your option is now worth $100.\n\nYour profit, then, is calculated like this: $100 (total amount you can make on one trading contract) - $37.50 (the price you paid for that contract) = $62.50 minus fees. You're in the money.\n\nSo, for every winner, there's a loser on the other end. It's a zero-sum game.\nA call option is essentially when you predict that the underlying asset will increase in price. Even if an underlying asset only increases by a tenth of a cent you still win in binary options trading.\nA put option is when you predict that the underlying asset will decrease in price. Here again you win even if the underlying asset only drops by just a tick.\nThe bid price is the maximum price that a buyer or buyers are willing to pay for an underlying asset. The ask price is the minimum amount a seller or sellers are willing to receive for an underlying asset. A trade or a transaction results when the two agree on a price.\n3. **Realize that market makers determine the bid and ask prices.** Market makers – or a person or brokerage house/bank – look at many variables to decide whether they believe the proposition will be true or false and are fairly confident they're on the winning side.\n\nIf the bid and ask are in the likes of $85 and $89, respectively, market makers are assuming there's a high probability that the proposition will result in a yes.\nIf the bid and ask are near $50, that's saying they're not sure.\nIf the bid and the ask are more like $10 and $15, they're indicating they think the answer will be no.\n4. **Understand you don't own the underlying asset.** Binary options trading merely involves speculation on the price of the underlying asset. It does not mean you own the asset itself. For example, when you buy a binary options contract you don't own stock in Google or own a certain amount of gold.\n5. **Recognize the risk and reward in relation to other options trading.** When trading in binary options, the gain or loss is fixed at $100 per options contract. In general options trading, the same isn't true. But that alone doesn't account for the difference. In options trading, one has to calculate the direction of the price as is required in binary options trading and the magnitude of the price move.\nThus in binary options trading there is more assured reward and a capped risk. Your profit or loss isn't determined by the price of the underlying asset at the time of expiry as it is with other options.\n6. **Learn about exercising options.** There are two types of binary exercising options: the American style and the European style. American-style options can be exercised (or settled) at any time prior to expiry. European-style options can only be exercised on the date of expiry or the last business day prior to expiry. With both in binary trading, you can change your position if you think your initial answer to the proposition will be wrong at expiry to a) cut your losses or b) lock in an early profit.\n7. **Know the three legal binary options contract markets in the U.S.** Due to widespread fraud involving binary options trading on Internet-based platforms, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved three markets or exchanges for trading binary options: Nadex, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Cantor Exchange.\nYou can make direct trades on each. Each has its own, very specific rules. Make sure you read them first.\n8. **Take measures to avoid dealing with fraudulent operations.** Much of the binary options trading market operates online, and many are not in compliance with U.S. regulations. It's recommended you do the following before trading with entities other than the three exchanges.\n\nCheck to see if the platform has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by checking its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR), which you can access here: [1].\nDetermine if the platform itself is registered as an exchange by looking at the SEC's website on exchanges located here: [2].\nFind out if the platform is a designated contract market by checking the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) list here: [3].\nFinally, check the registration status and background of any firm or financial professional by checking these two websites, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's BrokerCheck and the CFTC's fraud advisories: [4] and [5].\n9. **Know the exercise options and fees of each exchange.** The CBOE uses the European style, and options can only be exercised on the last business day prior to the date of expiry. However, it allows you to sell or buy back your position prior to expiry. Nadex uses the American style, as does the Cantor Exchange. Each of their fees differ as all, and this should be considered and calculated before trading.\n\nThe Cantor Exchange doesn't charge per trade. It does charge $.90 per contract at settlement if you're in the money. There's no charge at expiry if you're out of the money, and a $.45 charge if you're at the money. This means there's been no change in the price, so you neither win nor lose.\nNadex charges both trading and settlement fees. Trading fees are assessed twice – once to open and once to close a trade. It charges $.90 per contract up to 10 contracts; there are no fees per contract after that, so your total trading fee for each side of the trade is capped at $9.00. It charges $.90 per contract settlement (up to 10) that's in the money. There are no fees if you're out of the money.\nThe CBOE fees vary.\nOther platforms that trade through these exchanges charge fees, too, generally on top of the fees each exchange charges. Read the fine print carefully when using these platforms.\n10. **Analyze markets through fundamental analysis.** In broad terms, fundamental analysis is the study of all the external factors that can change the price of an asset. It looks at geo-political news like conflicts, elections, growth reports, employment, interest rate changes, etc. to then “ride the market's movement” and hopefully profit. It requires research – reading the news, studying world events, knowing the underlying trends in the markets you're trading, and the real situation on the ground as much as possible.\n\nFor example, if you're trading on the release of employment data in Canada, you can't go off of predictions that it will, for instance, rise. You also need to look at the types of jobs that were added, how many hours workers put in, who's getting the jobs, etc.\nThese will help you assess whether the price of the underlying asset – employment – rises or falls. Employment might rise, but the trading price may go down because of these other factors.\n11. **Utilize technical analysis.** Technical analysis involves using tools – typically graphical charts – to pull together statistics on a) trends such as new highs and lows for specific issues (stocks, commodities or currencies), b) the speed at which an asset's price rises or falls, which represents momentum, c) the volume and number of both declining and rising issues, and d) whether an asset is trading either above or below average, which indicates volatility.\n\nTypically it involves looking at this all from a historical perspective to make predictions about future trends. \n\nThe underlying suppositions in technical analysis are: the price of an asset is a reflection of all you need to know about that market; prices move according to trends; and history repeats itself.\nIt's concerned with internal factors – price and past performance.\nLook at the New York Stock Exchange's advance-decline breadth indicator, the Arm's Index and the Trader's Short-Term Index when examining market movement over time.\n\nUse these indicators for trends in high and lows: Moving Averages and Parabolic SAR (stop and reverse).\nExamine the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) and stochastics oscillators to assess momentum.\nStudy Bollinger bands, standard deviations and the Average True Range indicator for insight on volatility.\nAnalyze the On Balance Volume (OBV), the Chaikin Oscillator, and the Rate of Change Volume (ROCV) indicator for market volume.\n12. **Examine market sentiment.** Market sentiment is typically indicated by bullish behavior, such as buying call options and selling put options. It is also expressed by bearish behavior, such as buying put options or selling call options. Calculating the put-to-call ratio is a measure of market sentiment. To calculate this, divide the put volume by the call volume.\n\nWhen the ratio is low, you have a bearish market in which people are fearful. High ratios indicate the opposite.\nAll major exchanges publish their own versions of these ratios. They focus on equity, indices, retail activity and so forth.\nYour goal is to find the ratio that applies to the underlying asset you're considering trading on and use it to direct your answer to the proposition.\n13. **Sniff out fear.** Because people pull out when they're nervous, markets drop faster than they rise. Exchanges recognize this and even publish volatility indexes that you can use to help in your decision-making. You can also actually trade binary volatility options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX).\n14. **Trade on volatility.** Because volatility drives the sale and price of options and trading stock normally in a volatile market is risky, consider trading binary options on the volatility of the underlying market.\n\nThe first way is by buying or selling a market's direction at strike prices that are out of the money. This means they are cheaper. If you're the buyer and the strike price – the price of the underlying asset when the option is purchased – is higher at expiry, you win. If you're the seller and the strike price is below at expiry you win.\nThe second way is trading binaries that are in the money in what you believe will remain a flat market. The initial cost will be more, but if your prediction is correct and the market remains flat you will make a small profit.\n15. **Consider the ask size when trading.** The ask size is the number of contracts for an underlying asset that a market maker is offering to sell at the ask price. The market maker fills a customer's order with the lowest ask price for buys and the highest bid price for sells.\n\nThe higher the ask size the larger the supply of that underlying asset there is that the market maker wants to sell.\n\nA large supply means you may have more leverage in paying a lower price for the option. Remember, you don't have to pay the ask price. You simply need to exceed the current bid and hope it's accepted before you're outbid.\n16. **Take advantage of the knock-off effect.** This strategy is generally referred to as the Knock-Off Effect or Market Pull strategy. It's grounded in the assumption that the movement of one binary option will impact another. For instance, historically the price of gold drops when the US dollar (USD) rises, and the USD impacts how other currencies fare on the market. Your task is to learn about and monitor the markets for these correlations before placing a put or call.\nIt  uses both fundamental and technical analysis to determine your trade and is considered by some the most effective way to make money when trading binary options.\n17. **Hedge existing positions.** Buying binary put options on stocks you already own but think may drop in price a bit could offset losses in those stocks if they did, indeed, fall. This wouldn't protect you if the stock dropped significantly. It could help though if the dip was small-to-moderate. You can also hedge on losing binary positions by using shorter-term expiry binaries such as a five-minute binary.  Placing a put option in the direction of the loss can help you recoup your other loss as long as the asset continues moving in the losing direction.",

         "How to Lower DHEA",
         "Keeping your hormone levels in check can boost your quality of life in every way. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is one of the most important hormones in your body as it regulates the production of androgens and estrogens. However, having too much DHEA in your system may be associated hyperandrogenic effects. To lower your DHEA levels, start by eating a healthy diet, exercising, and getting the right amount of sleep. Talk with your doctor and ask them to monitor your levels over time. Be careful about any medications that you take and over time you should start to see and feel the positive results.\n1. **Talk with your doctor.** Make an appointment to see your general practitioner or an endocrinologist, a specialist who treats hormonal disorders. They will ask you about your medical history and run a blood test for DHEA levels. Bring a list of questions with you to get the most out of your appointment.\n\nA blood test may also be used to rule out any larger issues with your adrenal glands, such as Addison disease. The test is actually looking at DHEA-S because this is the form of DHEA your adrenal gland secretes.\n\nYour doctor will likely tell you that it is important to lower your DHEA as high levels can cause aggression and irregular blood pressure, among other health issues. Luckily, a benefit of reducing your DHEA levels is that most of these health concerns will disappear as your numbers drop.\n2. **Eat foods that are high in zinc** Certain minerals, such as zinc, may reduce swelling and inflammation throughout your body. If you’ve felt swollen lately and you know that your DHEA levels are high, zinc may be able to help you. Just make sure to talk with your doctor before taking any supplements. Eat more foods that are high in zinc:\n\nMeat, especially beef, pork, lamb, and the dark meat on chicken\nNuts\nBeans\nWhole grains\nYeast\n3. **Monitor any pre-existing conditions.** Your DHEA levels can have a direct impact on others areas of your health, including any prior diseases that you may be fighting. Along with your doctor, you may want to agree to additional monitoring for any diabetes, liver disease, or cancers while trying to lower your DHEA levels. This is a proactive approach that can keep you healthy in the long term.\n4. **Watch for any potential drug interactions.** Certain drugs have a side effect of boosting your DHEA levels. If you are trying to keep your levels lower, then talk with your doctor before starting any new medications. And, go through with them and evaluate all of the current medications that you are taking.\nFor example, diabetes drugs, such as metformin, are often associated with DHEA boosts.\n5. **Stop any synthetic DHEA supplements.** Talk with your doctor about gradually weaning off, or stopping cold turkey, any prescribed or over-the-counter hormonal medications that you are currently taking. It’s almost impossible to lower your DHEA while taking boosting medications.\nBe aware that the weaning off process can take months. Just stay patient and you will see positive results over time.\n6. **Agree to surgical treatment.** If your excess DHEA is caused by a sizeable tumor, then your doctor may suggest a removal procedure. Talk over the risks and rewards of any surgeries with your doctor before agreeing to anything. The benefit of surgery is that it will make it possible to lower your levels quickly.\n7. **Consult with your doctor before making any changes.** If you’d like to try to control your DHEA levels using diet and exercise, then make an appointment to talk over your ideas with your primary care physician. They may be able to give you some extra tips or advice as to what works and what doesn’t. They can also start to track your DHEA levels right away, so you’ll know how to modify your lifestyle changes.\n8. **Eat the right diet.** Just to be clear, foods do not contain DHEA directly. But, eating particular foods can encourage your body to produce more or less DHEA and other hormones. If you are trying to lower your levels, avoid foods that will elevate your DHEA, such as wild yams, sugars, wheat, and dairy products. Instead, follow a diet that emphasizes foods with anti-inflammatory properties, like tomatoes, olive oil, and salmon.\n9. **Exercise, but avoid over exercising.** Going to work out at least three times a week is a great way to keep your DHEA levels under control. Include cardio and weight sessions to see the most benefits. Working out will help you to build muscle and shed fat.\nKeep in mind that exercising too much may raise your DHEA levels, so it is important to avoid overdoing it.\n10. **Maintain a healthy body weight.** Look at the Body Mass Index (BMI) for a general guide as to where your weight should be as related to your height and age. When your body carries extra weight the fat cells store DHEA. Your body also produces excess estrogen, DHEA, and other hormones.\n11. **Get the right amount of sleep.** To better control your hormones, aim to get eight hours of sleep per night. Come up with a sleep schedule that works for you and stick with it.\n12. **Reduce your stress.** Your body is very sensitive to stress and may respond by producing excess hormones, such as DHEA. To keep your DHEA under control, find some ways to unwind in your daily life. Take up yoga, which you can do both at work and at home. Practice deep breathing techniques. Eat at least one meal outside each day to enjoy the fresh air. Go see a movie or a take a painting class with friends.\nYou can also ask your doctor to monitor your blood pressure levels alongside your DHEA results. If you engage in stress-relieving activities, you might see improvements across the board.\n13. **Watch for natural reductions with age.** DHEA levels usually peak right around the age of 20 when a person becomes fully hormonally and physically mature. Then, they start to naturally decline until almost no DHEA is left by the time you reach your 90s. Talk with your doctor about how to manage the age-based decline of your DHEA levels while also taking outside action, such as dietary changes.\n14. **Be careful not to go too low.** In your efforts to lower your DHEA levels, make sure that you go in for regular blood tests with your doctor. Changing up your body’s production of DHEA too much has been linked to some dangerous illnesses, such as certain cancers and type 2 diabetes.\n15. **Minimize any cortisol intake.** Cortisol shots have been linked to boosted DHEA levels. If you decide to take any medications with cortisol, which is a hormone itself, talk with your doctor about your concerns. Your doctor may also recommend cortisol as a partial replacement for a dip in DHEA levels. This is a strategy often used with athletes undergoing heavy training.\n16. **Choose a non-hormonal birth control.** The chemicals found in many birth control pills and shots can cause a boost in DHEA levels. To determine if you are taking a pill with testosterone-like effects, read your medication’s label and talk with your doctor. If you are considering a birth control shot, discuss the hormonal effects with your OB-GYN before moving forward.\nNon-hormonal methods, such as a copper IUD, have the same birth control benefits without the progestin risk. Many people experiencing migraines or hair loss with hormonal methods also find these to be a good alternative.\n17. **Make no changes at all.** If your high levels of DHEA are asymptomatic, or showing no outward symptoms, then you may safely choose to leave it generally untreated. Perhaps make some of the suggested lifestyle changes and see how those go. In some cases, even DHEA secreting tumors are left alone because the surgery can be more problematic than the excess hormones.",

         "How to Accept that Your Crush Doesn't Like You",
         "So you’ve just found out your crush doesn’t like you back. Now what? You might feel like moping around or pestering them in an attempt to change their mind, but that will most likely just leave you feeling worse, and possibly annoy your crush, too. The healthiest and most dignified thing to do in this situation is to accept the news and move on. You can get over the sting of rejection by keeping yourself busy, distancing yourself from your crush, and taking care of your emotional health.\n1. **Spend time on your hobbies.** Throw yourself into the things you enjoy doing to keep your mind off your crush. If you used to spend a lot of time thinking about the object of your affections, reclaim that time by putting it towards a new project, a good book, or a series on Netflix that you’ve been meaning to watch.\nIf you previously dropped some of your hobbies because you were distracted by your crush, picking them up again is a great way to move on.\n2. **Meet new people.** Instead of pining over someone who isn’t interested in you, mix it up with some new people who will appreciate how great you are. You don’t have to go looking for another crush just yet, but don’t be shy about reaching out to all kinds of people and making new friends.\nSchool, extracurricular activities, community clubs, and volunteer work are all good ways to meet people.\n3. **Try something that is completely different.** Expand your horizons and take your mind off the past by challenging yourself. If you’ve always wanted to do something but never worked up the nerve, there’s a no better time than right now to give it a try.\nFor example, you could audition for a play, take a solo trip, or apply for a new job.\n4. **Respect your crush’s boundaries.** Don’t try to change your crush’s mind or prove to them how great you are. This might get on their nerves, and worse, it will make you feel a little pathetic. Save your energy for someone who likes you, and leave your crush alone.\nRemember that there are many reasons your crush might not be interested in you. Maybe they’ve liked someone else for a long time, or maybe they like you as a friend but don’t think you’d be a compatible couple. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you.\n5. **Explain that you need some time to recover.** If you are friends with your crush, it’s normal to feel a little awkward around them after getting rejected. Let them know that you need some time away from them to get over your feelings. If they are a good friend, they’ll understand and respect your wishes.\nIf you aren’t really friends with your crush, you don’t need to explain to them that you’re taking some time away from them. In fact, it’s probably better if you don’t.\n6. **Unfollow or block your crush on social media.** Resist the urge to stalk your crush online by unfriending or unfollowing them on the social media platforms you use. If you’re worried about caving in and re-following them later, block them.\nYou can always re-add them in the future, once you’re over your feelings.\n7. **Stay away from places you think your crush may be.** Don’t try to get a glimpse of your crush in the hallway at school or in the break room at work, no matter how tempting the idea may be. Put as much distance as you can between yourself and them. If you have to see your crush every day, try to sit far away from them and avoid conversation.\nBe polite. It’s okay to say hello if you happen to see your crush, but don’t linger or try to start a conversation.\n8. **Avoid asking your friends about your crush.** If you and your crush have mutual friends, let them know that you’re trying to get over some feelings, and ask them not to talk about your crush around you for a while. Don’t ask what your crush is up to or whether they’re dating anybody since this might re-ignite your old emotions.\n9. **Avoid entertainment that reminds you of your crush.** Music, movies, and books can all be helpful in getting over an unrequited flame, but stay away from entertainment that helps you wallow in your feelings. If certain media makes you think about your crush, cut it out for a while and replace it with something that isn’t so emotionally loaded.\nTry indulging in escapism for a while. Look for novels and TV shows that transport you to worlds very different from your everyday life.\n10. **Accept your feelings.** Admit to yourself that you’re feeling bad about getting turned down. There’s nothing wrong with liking someone, and rejection is something almost everyone has experienced at some point. The sooner you come to terms with your feelings, the sooner you can heal from them and move on.\n11. **Grieve the loss of the potential relationship.** Even though you were not in a relationship with this person, in your mind, it may feel like you “lost” someone. Allow yourself time and space to grieve properly, then it will be easier to move on.\nHaving a crush is like having a one-sided imaginary relationship. In your mind, you develop an attachment to another person that is not reciprocated. You will need time and space to break that attachment.\n12. **Find support.** Seek out the company of people who value you, like your friends and family. It’s okay to cry or talk your problems through with them, especially at first, but try to have some fun with your loved ones too. A day out with your pals or a visit with extended family can do wonders for your mood and self-esteem.\n13. **Make a list of your good qualities.** Sit down with pen and paper, and spend a few minutes brainstorming all the reasons someone would be lucky to be with you. Include overall positive traits like kindness, as well as little quirks like always remembering someone’s favorite foods. Save your list so you can look at it when you feel down about yourself.\n14. **Think about your crush’s negative traits.** Nobody’s perfect, and your previously rosy view of your crush might have hidden their bad qualities. Now that you have a bit more distance from them, think of everything that bothers you about your crush, from their weird laugh to their inability to remember your name. You’ll be feeling less love-struck in no time.\n15. **Express yourself creatively.** Channel your feelings into your writing, drawing, music, or any other kind of art you like to make. You can show other people your finished work, or keep it private – it’s up to you.\n16. **Practice good self-care.** Your heart and ego are probably feeling a little bruised, so be gentle with yourself as you recover. Cut yourself a bit of slack at school or work. Instead of burying your sadness with endless movie-and-takeout sessions, do your best to eat well and get some exercise, and treat yourself to things that make you feel good about yourself.\nFor instance, you could spend an afternoon at your favorite coffee shop or get a new haircut that you love.",

         "How to Treat a Corn or Callus",
         "A corn or callus is an area of thick, hardened, dead skin, caused by friction and irritation. Corns form on the sides and tops of the toes, and can be quite painful. A callus typically forms on the bottom or sides of the feet and can be uncomfortable and unsightly, but does not usually become painful. Calluses can also form on the hands. Corns and calluses can typically be treated at home, but if yours are painful, persistent, or if you have an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, medical treatment may be necessary.\n1. **Differentiate between a corn and a callus.** Corns and calluses are not the same thing, therefore the treatment approaches are different.\n\nA corn can develop between the toes, has a core, and can be quite painful. Corns also develop along the tops of the toes, most often located just above a joint in the toe.\n\nCorns are categorized as hard, soft, or periungual. A hard corn most commonly develops on the top of the toe and over a bone joint. A soft corn develops between the toes, usually between the fourth and fifth toes. A periungual corn is less common, and occurs along the edge of a nailbed.\n\nA core is not always present, but is usually found at the center of the corn. The core consists of thick and dense skin tissue.\n\nThe core of the corn points inward and often presses on a bone or nerve which causes it to be quite painful.\n\nA callus does not have a core, and is a broader area that is made of evenly distributed thicker tissue.  Calluses are not usually painful, although they can be uncomfortable.\n\nCalluses usually develop on the bottom of the foot and just beneath the toe area. Calluses can also develop on the hands, usually on the palm side and just under the fingers.\n\nBoth corns and calluses are caused by friction and pressure.\n2. **Use over-the-counter remedies.** Salicylic acid is the most common ingredient found in over-the-counter products used to treat corns and calluses.\n\nThe use of over-the-counter products is helpful in removing corns and calluses, but their use is more effective when combined with general measures to take care of the skin.\n\nTake steps to treat the immediate problem, but be sure to correct the problem causing the friction or pressure.\n3. **Apply salicylic acid pads to remove a corn.** Salicylic acid corn remover pads are available without prescription in strengths as strong as 40%.\n\nSoak the foot in warm water for about five minutes to soften the tissue. Dry the foot and toes thoroughly before applying the pads.\n\nTake care not to apply the pad against healthy skin tissue.\n\nMost products recommend repeating the procedure every 48 to 72 hours, for up to 14 days, or until the corn is removed.\n\nSalicylic acid is classed as a keratolytic agent. This means it helps to bring added moisture to the area while working to soften and dissolve skin tissue. Salicylic acid can be harmful to healthy tissue.\n\nFollow the instructions on the product or in the product literature. Do not use if you are allergic to salicylic acid products.\n\nAvoid getting salicylic acid products in your eyes, nose, or mouth, and do not use on any other area of the body without instructions from your doctor.\n\nRinse any areas accidentally exposed to salicylic acid with water immediately.\n\nKeep salicylic acid products stored in a safe manner, away from children and pets.\n4. **Use salicylic acid for calluses.** Salicylic acid comes in a variety of forms and a multitude of strengths. Foams, lotions, gels, and pads are available that can be used to treat callused areas on your foot.\nEach product has unique application instructions. Follow the direction on the product or in the product literature to effectively use salicylic acid products to get rid of calluses.\n5. **Use topical products with 45% urea.** Other than treatment with salicylic acid, other products are available over-the-counter that may be helpful.\n\nProducts that contain 45% urea can be used topically as keratolytics to help soften and remove unwanted tissue, including corns and calluses.\n\nFollow the directions provided on the product label or contained in the product literature.\n\nRoutine directions for using 45% topical urea products include twice daily applications until the condition has resolved.\n\nDo not ingest topical urea products, and do not get them in your eyes, nose, or mouth.\n\nKeep the products away from children and pets.\n\nIf swallowed, call 911, call a poison control center, or seek emergency medical attention the fastest way possible.\n6. **Use a pumice stone.** For callused areas, using a pumice stone or file designed for the foot, can help to get rid of the hardened areas of skin. They're especially helpful on broad, callused areas, like the heel or the bottom of your feet.\n\nThis can also be used for unwanted calluses that form on the hands.\n\nUsing a device like a pumice stone or file helps to remove layers of dead skin. Take care not to file away healthy tissue. Doing so can lead to further irritation and possibly infection if the healthy skin is broken.\n\nFile away layers of thickened and hard tissue before you apply medication.\n7. **Soak your feet.** Soaking your feet in warm water helps to soften the thickened areas of tissue for both corns and calluses.\n\nFor unwanted calluses on your hands, soaking the area can help to soften the tissue just as it does for your feet.\n\nDry your feet or hands thoroughly after soaking. While your skin tissue is soft after soaking, proceed with using your pumice stone or file..\nEven if you don’t have time to soak your feet or hands every day, use the pumice stone or file just after getting out of your bath or shower.\n8. **Keep your skin moist.** Apply moisturizers to your feet and hands to help keep the tissues soft.\n\nThis can make it easier to remove the hardened thick areas of skin with a pumice stone or file, as well as help to prevent the formation of corns and calluses.\n\nSince the skin on your feet is very thick, use a thick lotion to ensure it's able to penetrate deep enough to soften your feet.\n9. **Pursue medical help in treating the condition.** If you have a callus or corn that's deeply seated in one area, it's probably best to have that treated at a podiatrist's office. Also, if you have diabetes, you are at greater risk of serious foot problems partly caused by changes in circulation to your extremities, so it's especially important to see a doctor.\nMedical conditions like diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and any other condition that interferes with normal blood flow, warrant medical help to treat corns and calluses. Talk to your doctor before treating your corns or calluses at home.\n10. **Ask your doctor for instructions if the areas are large and painful.** While corns and calluses rarely fall in the category of a medical emergency, sometimes the areas are very large and quite painful.\n\nSeeking help from your doctor is the safest and most effective way to proceed with treatment.\n\nSome corns and calluses are resistant to the available over-the-counter treatment options. Ask your doctor about prescription strength products or procedures that may be helpful.\n\nYour doctor can help by performing some in-office procedures to improve the condition.\n\nUsing a scalpel or other tool available in the medical office, your doctor can help to trim away large areas of excess and hardened skin.\n\nDo not attempt to trim very thick areas of hardened skin at home. This may lead to more irritation, bleeding, and possible infection.\n11. **Look for warts.** In addition to corns and calluses, sometimes warts are part of the problem.\nYour doctor can help determine if warts, or any other skin condition, is involved and recommend the best treatment approach.\n12. **Watch for signs of infection.** Very rarely, the corns or calluses may become infected.\nSee you doctor as soon as possible if any area of your foot or hand is red, swollen, feels warm to the touch, or is more tender than normal.\n13. **Consider foot conditions that cause misalignment.** Some people have deformities in their feet that cause them to have repeated problems, including recurrent problems with corns and calluses.\n\nYour doctor may refer you to a podiatrist for treatment. Some conditions that may be contributing to the problems you are having with corns and calluses include hammer toe, bone spurs, lower than normal natural arches, and bunions.\n\nMany of these conditions can be corrected by wearing inserts or specially designed footwear.\n\nIn rare cases, surgery may be warranted.\n14. **Watch for complications on your hands.** When calluses develop from a source of friction or pressure on your hands, it is possible for the skin to break and an infection can begin.\n\nIn some cases, blisters form along with, just beneath, or beside the calluses. When this happens, fluid is contained inside the blisters, which is naturally absorbed back into the skin with time. If the blisters pop or drain, it is easy to get an infection started in the healthy tissue around the blisters and calluses.\n\nContact your doctor if your hand appears reddened, swollen, or warm to the touch.\n\nTopical or systemic antibiotics may be needed if you have an infection.\n15. **Eliminate the source of friction.** The most common cause of corns and calluses on the feet is something causing irritation, pressure, or friction in the same spot.\nBy eliminating the source of the friction, you can prevent corns and calluses from forming.\n16. **Wear shoes that fit properly.** Shoes that do not fit can rub against your toes or cause your foot to slide inside the shoe.\n\nBe sure your toes have plenty of wiggle room inside your shoes.\n\nCorns develop along the tops and sides of your toes, and can be due to wearing shoes that do not give your toes enough room.\n\nRepeated rubbing or irritation caused by shoes that do not fit properly are a major cause of corns of calluses.\n\nTightly fitting shoes and shoes with high heels that cause your fit to slide forward can cause corns and calluses to develop.\n\nCalluses develop when the bottom or side of the foot slides against a part of the shoe that is irritating, or slides inside of shoes that are too large.\n17. **Wear socks.** Going without socks can cause your feet to experience friction and pressure from your shoes.\n\nAlways wear socks to prevent the friction and pressure. Especially in shoes that are designed to wear socks, such as athletic foot wear, heavy work shoes, and boots.\n\nBe sure your socks fit properly. Socks that are too tight can squeeze your toes causing unwanted pressure and friction. Loosely fitting socks can slide down on your foot while in the shoe and contribute to added friction and pressure on areas of your foot.\n18. **Apply protective coverings.** Use pads placed on top of the areas where the corns develop, between your toes, or along areas where the calluses form.\nUsing pads, sections lamb’s wool, or toe separators can help to reduce the friction and pressure along your toe or foot area where the corns and calluses are located.\n19. **Wear gloves.** Calluses form on your hands at the areas of greatest friction.\n\nIn many cases, calluses on the hand are welcomed. One example involves people that play musical instruments. Guitar players, for instance, appreciate the calluses that form on the tips of their fingers. This helps them to play their instrument without pain.\n\nAnother example is athletes that lift weights. The calluses that form on their hands can help them to grasp and manipulate the bars used in weight lifting.",

         "How to Get Bright White Eyes",
         "The whites of your eye are called the sclera, and these can indicate a person’s overall health. Having yellowish or reddish sclera can be challenging in terms of personal vanity, since they can make a person look older or tired. They can also signal health issues related to allergens, toxins in the body, and even more serious liver problems. There are several remedies that can treat or counteract redness or yellowness in your eyes, ranging from using eye drops to changing your diet to applying makeup strategically.\n1. **Use regular eye drops like Visine or Clear Eyes.** These eye drops are used to reduce redness in your eyes and give them a bit of moisture to counteract irritants or otherwise dryness in the eyes. Visine, Clear Eyes, and other brands can be purchased at grocery and drug stores, as well as larger stores like Target, Walmart, and so on. Put 1-2 drops in the affected eye. Consult the instructions on the bottle for additional information.\nDon't use eyedrops like Visine or Clear Eyes too often. While they give good immediate results, when used regularly, they actually prevent your eyes from creating their own natural lubrication, and your eyes may become chronically dry, red, and dependent on the drops. A safer option is saline drops or gentle eyedrops like Systane that mimic natural tears.\n2. **Try thicker viscosity eye drops.** A Japanese brand of eye drops called Rohto is a product that is thicker than natural tears. They have cooling properties that relieve burning eyes and they reduce redness as well. These are available at grocery and drug stores. If you have not used any eye drops before, these might not be the best ones to start with, as they can feel a little harsh to the eye.\n3. **Try blue eye drops.** A company from Switzerland, Innoxa, makes eye drops that are actually colored blue. In addition to relieving burning and redness symptoms, Innoxa Blue Drops also coat your eyes with a light film of blue, which counteracts the yellowish tinge in your eyeballs to make them appear whiter.\n4. **Eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables.** Orange and yellow fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, pumpkins, lemons and oranges, contain vitamins and antioxidants that will help keep your eyes white. Eating green, leafy foods like spinach and kale also have a positive effect on your eye health. Nuts like almonds, walnuts and peanuts also contain minerals that promote eye health.\nThese fruits and veggies will also help to detoxify your liver. A healthy liver will help keep the whites of your eyes clear and bright. If your liver is full of toxins, then it may not be able to process foods and vitamins as efficiently as it should. Detoxify your liver by drinking a glass of beetroot juice on an empty stomach, or eating carrots and spinach.\n5. **Reduce refined sugars and carbohydrates in your diet.** Reducing the amount of foods that contain refined carbohydrates and sugars, as well as wheat, can help your body process foods better and detoxify your liver. Decrease the amount of unhealthy foods you eat, particularly at night, which can interfere with a good sleep pattern.\n6. **Take supplements.** Your eyes depend on good levels of Vitamin A and C to maintain their health. In addition to eating foods rich in these vitamins, take a supplemental vitamin every day. Also boost your level of omega 3 acids by taking 4 capsules every day of omega 3 or fish oil supplements.\n7. **Get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night.** Getting enough sleep every night will ensure that your body is rested and consequently that your eyes are rested and restored to their natural white color. Get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night. If you are having trouble falling asleep, try soothing music or 10 minutes of meditation before going to bed to ensure that your body knows that it’s time to sleep.\n8. **Drink plenty of water.** Bright white eyes rely on adequate hydration, and keeping your body hydrated will help replenish your body’s fluids, thus reducing puffiness and redness in your eyes. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of plain water every day, or approximately 64 ounces.\n9. **Cut down on alcohol and caffeine.** Both of these will dehydrate your body and add to puffiness and redness to your eyes. They also can interrupt good sleep patterns, which may interfere with you getting 7-8 hours of sleep every night.\n10. **Avoid irritants like smoke, dust and pollen.** Smoking irritates the eyes and can cause redness. It can also dry out the eyes. Eliminating smoking from your daily habits can help your eyes restore their natural color and hydration. Dust that can be found both outside and inside can also irritate your eyes and make them prone to redness. Pollen and other allergens might also contribute to eye irritation. Use an air purifier indoors to reduce these irritants if they are hard to avoid.\n11. **Reduce eyestrain.** Working on a computer all day long can take a toll on your eyes, but it might not be an option to reduce the amount of time you spend on the computer. If you must work on a computer for several hours every day, then you should address ways to help reduce eyestrain. These can include installing proper lighting, changing your computer’s settings so that your monitor is the same brightness as the rest of the room, blink more often, exercise your eyes, and so on.\n12. **Wear sunglasses when you are outside.** UVA and UVB rays can damage your eyes over time, and exposure to sunlight contributes to yellowing your eyes. Wear sunglasses that protect your eyes from UVA and UVB rays. Most sunglasses available today will have this feature, but be sure to check the label. Try to wear sunglasses whenever there is even a little glare outside. There doesn’t need to be blue skies and sun for you to need sunglasses. On cloudy days, there may be quite a lot of glare that can strain and damage your eyes.\n13. **Visit your doctor.** You may have a medical condition called jaundice that contributes to yellowish eyes. Jaundice is a condition when hemoglobin in your blood is broken down into bilirubin and does not clear through your body properly. If the bilirubin builds up in the skin, it causes the skin and eyes to appear yellow. Jaundice can indicate a medical issue most commonly having to do with the liver, gall bladder, or pancreas. Talk with your doctor to rule out jaundice and any underlying diseases or conditions that may be contributing to yellowish eyes.\n14. **Try Ayurvedic remedies.** Ayurvedic medicine originated in India about 3,000 years ago and uses natural remedies and practices to prevent and treat health conditions. Triphala is an herbal mixture used in Ayurvedic medicine that can treat a number of conditions, including improving eye health and eye whiteness. It accomplishes this in part by detoxifying the body. Triphala can be purchased at Indian food import stores as a powder or in tablet form.\n\nUse triphala as an eye wash. Dissolve one tablespoon of the powder in 8 ounces of water overnight. Strain this mixture and then sprinkle it over your eyes or use as an eye wash.\n\nA word of caution: triphala is also used as a laxative to correct constipation, so proceed carefully with using it.\nOne of the main ingredients in triphala is Indian gooseberry, the juice of which can be dropped directly into your eyes at night to improve their whiteness.\n15. **Rub carrot juice on your eyelids.** Eating carrots will improve your eye health, and so will topical application of the juice. Wash and dry several carrots, and chop off their ends. Process several carrots through a juicer to get healthy carrot juice that can then be applied on your eyelids. Leave the juice on your eyelids overnight. Be careful not to put the juice directly into your eyes.\n16. **Use a cold compress on your eyes.** Putting your skin in contact with something cold will help reduce puffiness, but it can also help whiten your eyes as well. Soak a washcloth in ice water, wring it out, and lay the washcloth over your eyes for 5-10 minutes. The redness in your eyes should diminish after repeating this a few times over the course of a day.\n17. **Brighten the area under your eyes.** Dark circles under your eyes will make your eyes appear dull. Brighten up the area under and around your eyes by applying concealer. Dab several small dots of concealer across the bottom of your eye and gently tap across the dots to blend them with the rest of your skin.\n18. **Use blue tones of eye shadow and eyeliner.** Adding navy or indigo blue colors around your eyes will be somewhat softer than the drama and harshness of black colors. Also, the blue tones will help to counteract yellowish colors that might show up in the whites of your eyes, which will make your eyes appear brighter and clearer.\n19. **Use eyeliner.** These days white eyeliner could be easily found in market. Just a swipe or two of white eyeliner on your eyelid will not only make them brighter will also make them wider. You can also take little white eyeliner near corner of your lids and blend it, this will give an angel like look. Your face will look dewy and very fresh.\n20. **Use brown mascara on your bottom lashes.** Making your eyes stand out can help them appear whiter. Using black mascara on both top and bottom lashes will make dramatic eyes, but they do not help your eyes look whiter. Instead, try brown mascara on your bottom lashes. This softer color will help draw the attention upwards to your top lashes, which will make your eyes appear wider, more alert and whiter.\n21. **Try a light-colored eyeliner.** By using a light bone-colored or flesh-colored eyeliner, your eyes will attract and reflect light, which will help make it seem like your eyes are larger. Outline the inner corners of your eyes with the eyeliner to give the illusion of being brighter.\n\nApply a shimmering white or light-colored eye shadow in the inner corners of your eyes to attain a similar effect.\n\nTry to refrain from using a white eyeliner pencil to outline your eye, as this can be hard to blend in properly and may look too \"staged\" or artificial.\n22. **Use an eyelash curler.** An eyelash curler, which is readily available at drug stores and grocery stores for about $5 to $6, will clamp your eyelashes and bend them upwards in a curl. Curling your lashes upward will make your eyes appear to be bigger and more open. They can also draw attention to your eyes by making your eyelashes appear longer.\n23. **Use a bit of pink blush.** Apply pink blush to the apples of your cheeks, your lips, and across the highest point of your eyebrows. This will lighten and brighten your entire face, which will help make your eyes appear brighter and whiter.",

         "How to Apply Body Spray",
         "Body sprays are a great way to help girls and guys feel fresh without the overpowering element of a perfume or cologne. For men, apply the body spray on your chest and neck, and under your armpits. For women, apply the body spray on your pulse points, clothes and hair. For long lasting results, apply the body spray after you shower and layer fragrances.\n1. **Remove your shirt.** Body sprays for men usually double as deodorants. So it is more effective to use the spray on your body as opposed to your clothes.\n2. **Spray your upper body.** Hold the spray can six inches (152 mm) away from your body. Press the spray button and spray your armpits, chest and neck. Spray each body part for only two to three seconds.\nFor more coverage, hold the spray can farther away from your body, like seven to nine inches (178 to 229 mm).\n3. **Apply the spray once per day.** In general, body sprays have a very strong scent. By applying the spray only once per day, you can avoid overloading your senses, and the senses of the people around you. You also want to avoid over spraying since there may be negative health effects associated with using body sprays excessively.\nThe only exception is if you plan to exercise or engage in sports or another physical activity that will cause you to perspire. If this is you, then you may re-apply the body spray after the physical activity.\n4. **Spray your pulse points.** Hold the body spray four to five inches (102 to 127 mm) from your pulse points. Spray each pulse point with one spray. Try to avoid rubbing in the spray. Instead, let the body spray soak in and dry on your skin.\n\nYour pulse points include your wrists, the insides of your elbows, the front of your neck, the back of your knees and between your breasts.\nYour body emits pheromones from pulse points, and these points are excellent places to apply your body spray to ensure the longevity of the scent.\n5. **Spritz your clothing.** Do this once you have spritzed your pulse points. However, hold the spray can seven to nine inches (178 to 229 mm) from your body/clothes. Spritz your top and pants once or twice.\nAlternatively, you can spritz the air in front of you and walk through the mist to scent your clothes.\n6. **Spray your hair.** Try to avoid spraying your hair directly. Instead, spritz the air above you once or twice with the spray. Quickly stand underneath the mist to lightly scent your hair.\n7. **Choose a fragrance you like.** Choose a scent that matches your personal taste and style. Start by sampling popular fragrances to see which scents appeal to your taste. Then explore other fragrances that are made with similar scents.\n\nIf you are a girl, then you may prefer sweet, floral scents or musky scents.\nIf you are a guy, then you may prefer woodsy or spicy scents.\n8. **Apply the body spray after you shower.** Applying body spray on a clean body will help the scent stick to your body better and last longer. After you shower, lightly towel off. Spritz your damp body with the body spray.\n9. **Layer fragrances.** Layering fragrances will also help your body spray last longer. While you are showering, use a body gel that has similar scents to the ones in your body spray. After your shower, apply a lotion with similar scents to your damp body. Once the lotion has dried, spritz your body with the body spray.\n\nFor example, if your body spray contains vanilla, lavender and mint notes, then choose a body wash and lotion that contains lavender, vanilla or mint to layer with.\nIf you cannot find a complementary lotion or body wash, then use an unscented lotion or soap.\nSome body sprays come with complementary lotions and body washes.",

         "How to Clean a Fabric Sofa Naturally (DIY Upholstery Cleaning Solutions)",
         "Why pay hundreds of dollars to get your couch professionally cleaned when you can do it at home? Cleaning a fabric couch is surprisingly easy and cheap—and you can do it without harsh chemicals. Whether you have a microfiber, suede, velvet, or synthetic upholstered couch, these methods will work as long as your couch tag is labeled W or WS. We’ll walk you through the steps to use baking soda and vinegar cleaning solutions to treat stains and freshen up your upholstery. First, we’ll cover basic dirt removal and deodorizing, then we’ll cover stain removal, deep cleaning, and steam cleaning.\n1. **Check your couch tag for cleaning instructions.** The couch tag will likely say either W, WS, S, or X.​​ You’re good-to-go with DIY cleaning solutions if the couch says W or WS, but you shouldn’t try these methods if your couch says S or X.\n\nW means you can use a water-based cleaner (as we’ll explore in this article).\nWS means you can use either a water-based cleaner or a commercial solvent. The cleaning solutions in this article will also work for you.\nS means you can only use a solvent and shouldn’t attempt a DIY cleaning method.\nX means you can only vacuum the couch. You can damage the fabric if you try cleaning it with a solution.\n2. **Vacuum up any loose dirt.** Use your vacuum’s upholstery brush and crevice tool to remove debris, pet hair, and crumbs. Vacuum all the couch cushions. Then, if you have removable cushions, take them off so you can get into the nooks and crannies of the couch frame.\nDon’t forget to vacuum along the tops of the couch and the armrests, since those areas get touched frequently.\n3. **Deodorize your couch with baking soda.** This method is safe for all couches because it doesn’t involve liquid cleaner. Generously sprinkle baking soda all over the couch frame and cushions. Wait 15 minutes as the baking soda naturally deodorizes the fabric. Then, vacuum it up for a smell-free couch.\n\nTurn off the fans in the room before you start sprinkling the baking soda.\nThis method works on all fabric sofas, but it’s particularly good for cleaning linen sofas without damaging them.\n4. **Mix equal parts white vinegar and water for a simple solution.** Pour a 1:1 ratio of vinegar to water into a spray bottle. Give the bottle a shake to combine the mixture. Spray the solution directly onto the stain.\n\nWait up to 5 minutes to sanitize the stain (particularly if you have stains from pets).\n\nGently blot the spot-treated area with a clean cloth.\nRemove any leftover cleaner by taking a clean, damp rag and lightly wiping the spot-treated area. Then, take a clean cloth and pat the area dry.\n\nBe sure to use clean white cloths to avoid transferring color from the rag onto your upholstery.\n\nIt’s always a good idea to test the solution in an inconspicuous area to make sure you won’t change the color of your couch or damage the fabric.\n5. **Try a diluted soap and water solution for tough stains.** You can add a few drops of natural dish soap into a spray bottle filled with water for this easy solution. If you don’t have a spray bottle, that’s no problem! Just use a rag to blot the stain.\n6. **Use white bar soap for an easy stain remover.** Rub any white bar soap into a damp microfiber cloth. Then, all you have to do is gently blot the fabric with the rag until you’ve lifted the stain. Follow up with a damp, clean rag to remove any leftover soap residue.\n7. **Dampen a cloth with rubbing alcohol to treat ink stains.** Pour rubbing alcohol onto a rag so that the rag is slightly damp but not sopping wet. Gently blot the fabric to lift the stain. Press straight down with the cloth and don’t rub the stain. Use a damp, clean cloth to pull up any excess ink and rubbing alcohol.\n8. **Mix your DIY baking soda and vinegar cleaner.** Just stir the ingredients below into a bucket. You can use just white vinegar, baking soda, and water, or you can add a natural soap or detergent to help cut through grease and oil.\n\n2 tablespoons (15 mL) laundry detergent or natural liquid soap\n2 tablespoons (15 mL) white vinegar\n2 tablespoons (28 g) baking soda\n2 cups (470 mL) warm water\nNatural or “green” detergents and soaps contain fewer harsh chemicals and are derived from plants.\n9. **Dampen a rag with your cleaning solution.** Wring out any excess liquid so that you don’t soak the couch. Alternatively, if you have a spray bottle, use it to spray the solution onto the couch for a more even distribution.\n10. **Wipe the rag with the solution over all the fabric.** Use a circular motion and rub gently to remove dirt. Pay close attention to the armrests and cushions, where oil from people’s skin tends to build up.\n11. **Allow the fabric to air-dry before using the sofa.** Don’t use heat to dry your couch or you might accidentally damage the fabric. If you just can’t wait to sit down on your new clean couch, open up doors and windows, or set up a fan to create a breeze and speed up drying time.\nCouches typically take 8-12 hours to dry.\n12. **Pick a steamer designed for fabric and upholstery use.** Steer clear of carpet steamers. Even though carpet cleaners come with lots of attachments, they can easily soak your couch and be really tough to maneuver over upholstery.\nSteam cleaning is optional, but it’s a great way to disinfect your couch, kill mold and mites, and deep-clean the fabric.\n13. **Prepare the cleaning solution for your steam cleaner.** To go for an all-natural approach, just use water (either tap or distilled) in your machine. If you’d like to use a cleaning solution, check your machine’s instructions for the ratio of solution to water.\nBe careful not to use too much cleaning solution because it can be hard to remove from your sofa fabric or damage your machine.\n14. **Use repeated, swift strokes to clean the sofa cushions first.** Steam 1 side of a cushion at a time. Before you move onto the next side, let the side you just steamed dry. Otherwise, you’ll trap moisture under the cushions and get a mildew/mold smell.\n15. **Steam in repeated passes over the rest of the couch.** Clean in sections about the size of each cushion, without holding the steamer still in one place for too long. The section-by-section approach prevents you from totally soaking the couch. You don’t want to damage the fabric with too much moisture!\n16. **Let your couch air-dry before using it.** The time your couch takes to dry will depend on humidity and the exact fabric, but you might have to wait 8-12 hours. Run a towel over the couch if you’d like to wipe up any remaining grime and speed up the drying process. Otherwise, open windows and doors to let the couch air dry.",

         "Adding a bathroom to your basement can be a fairly long and complicated process. This article will get you through the initial stage of this project, the rough plumbing. The steps are based on personal experience and offer a straightforward guide to the various aspects of the project. Be sure to check with local building codes when deciding the placement of the new sink and toilet!\n1. **Gather your materials:** Metal detector\nScratch paper\nTape measure\n2. **Identify the main waste stack that goes from the upstairs bathroom to the sewer.** This will be a vertical cast iron pipe, more than likely 4\" in diameter.\n3. **Detect the cast iron pipe leading from the main waste stack to the sewer using a metal detector.** This is the pipe in the ground that the new toilet and sink will flow in to.\n4. **Identify where you want the sink and the toilet to be placed in the basement.** A crude drawing may be helpful to visualize where the you want the new sink and toilet in relation to the existing pipe.\nThis will also help you when you measure out the length of PVC you'll need.\n5. **Plan the location of the new PVC pipe that will connect the new toilet and sink to the cast iron pipe in the ground.** It is recommended that it be a 45 degree PVC pipe that attaches to the existing cast iron to help with the flow of waste.\nBe sure to note that the PVC setup will vary depending on where the sink and toilet will be placed.\n6. **Prepare your materials:** Box cutter knife/chisel\nSafety Glasses\nChalk/tape\nJackhammer\nBucket/spade\nPlastic curtain\n7. **Remove any tile/carpeting/etc to expose the concrete above the spot you chose to place the new pipe.** \n8. **Draw an outline in chalk or tape on the concrete floor where you will need break it, based on where you decided the new toilet and sink will go.** Hanging a plastic curtain around the work area can help contain dust!\n9. **Break the floor to expose the necessary section of the cast iron pipe as well as the path that the new pipe will lay for the toilet and sink.** This can be done with a jackhammer which can be rented at a home improvement store.\nSafety glasses should be worn when using tools!\n10. **Clear out the concrete debris and dig out the sand so the new pipe has a place to lay.** \n11. **Collect the needed materials:** Necessary sections of PVC as determined in Part 1\nPVC primer and cement\nSaw (hand or electric) for cutting PVC into shape\nAngle grinder\nBand-seal couplings and screwdriver\n12. **Purchase the necessary length of PVC pipe that the new toilet and sink will flow into.** \n13. **Connect the pipe together in the shape that fits your design.** Use PVC primer and cement to fasten the sections together\nDue to chemical fumes, make sure the area is well ventilated!\n14. **Cut an appropriate section of the cast iron pipe so the new PVC will fit in it.** This can be done with a high speed angle grinder\nThe angle grinder will make sparks, be sure to wear safety glasses!\n15. **Attach the new PVC to the cast iron with band-seal couplings.** Make sure that there is enough PVC on either side of the wye so that the band-coupling has enough of both PVC and cast iron pipe to attach to!\nCleaning the cast iron pipe makes for a tighter seal!\n16. **Prepare the materials you'll need:** Bags of sand\nBags of Ready Mix concrete\nMason trowels\n17. **Cover over the pipe over with sand.** Make sure the new pipe has a slope of at least 1/4\" every foot flowing into the cast iron pipe.\n18. **Cover over the sand with approx.** 4\" of concrete so that just the pipes that the toilet will sit on and the sink will connect to are exposed.\n19. **Smooth out the concrete with the mason trowel so that new flooring can be added later.** ",

         "Hoping to add a perfect Garchomp to your team? You've got good taste—a Garchomp is a very strong and cool pseudo-legendary Pokémon that can be practically invincible when trained well. We've outlined everything you need to know, so you can add this crazy-strong Pokémon to your roster in Pokémon Diamond, Pokémon Pearl, or Pokémon Platinum.\n1. **Get a Gible with the Adamant or Jolly nature.** You can either keep on catching Gible until you get one or you can breed until you get one. Giving the Gible parent an Everstone to hold will probably increase the chances of getting a good nature. These natures are the ones that you'll want because they don't lower any of Garchomp's perfect stats.\nJolly might be the best, because then Salamence, Pikachu, and Celebi will not be faster than your Garchomp, and you can outrun faster Pokémon such as Gengar.\n2. **Train your Gible so it gets 252 Attack EVs and 252 Speed EVs.** You can use Protein and Carbos for the first 100 EVs in each stat if you have enough money.\n3. **Your Gible can learn powerful moves via TMs or by leveling up.** If you do not mind extra training, then breed for a Gible egg. Its stats (could) be higher and it can learn powerful egg moves like Thrash. Placing it in the day-care will require a lot of walking, but allows higher EV training.\n4. **This evolution occurs at Level 24.** \n5. **Fight Pokémon with normally high Attack or Speed stats.** This will raise Gabite/Garchomp's total ability.\n6. **Continue to teach it powerful moves.** You can do this as your Pokémon levels up, or by teaching it TMs.\n7. **Decide whether you want a powerful attack or a powerful ability.** At level 49, the Gabite can learn Dragon Rush, a highly powerful but slightly inaccurate move. Evolving it at level 48 will give a marginal amount of extra Attack. Evolving it at level 49 lets you learn Dragon Rush earlier. It's your choice.\n8. **Certain moves are especially powerful on Garchomp.** Consider teaching it moves like Earthquake, Stone Edge, Rockslide, Dragon Claw, Dragon Rush, Dual Chop, Outrage, Dragonbreath, Dragon Pulse, or Draco Meteor. Some other potentially good moves are:\n\nFire Fang\nCrunch\nDragon Dance\nSubstitute\nProtect\n9. **A Choice Scarf or Choice Band are great options.** \n10. **You may win many more matches than you previously did.** If you use Garchomp on the same team as a Tyranitar, Garchomp will get a 20% chance to avoid getting hit. Just remember to have other Pokémon that can take in Water, Grass, Ice, Fighting, and Fairy attacks.\nAnother good idea if you want to do this is to give it a Yache Berry to hold. This will let your Garchomp survive most Ice type attacks.",

         "How to Choose Between a Psychiatrist and a Psychologist",
         "Psychologists and psychiatrists do many of the same things, but there are also key differences in training and treatment that may help you to make a decision. Although both types of professionals are highly trained, you may find that one type of mental health professional is better suited to meet your needs than the other. By considering the training differences and treatment types available from each type of professional, you can make an informed decision about your treatment.\n1. **Learn about the differences between the professions.** Psychiatrists and psychologists are both mental health professionals who diagnose, prevent, and treat mental disorders like anxiety and depression. Psychologists use psychotherapy to treat mental illness, while psychiatrists are medical doctors who prescribe psychotropic drugs to help manage mental illness. \n\n\n have a doctorate in Psychology (either a Ph.D. or a PsyD.) which usually includes lessons on human behavior, ethics, research, and making psychological assessments which usually takes 4-8 years to complete. They cannot prescribe medicine.\n\n are physicians who specialize in mental health. They must have a medical degree (MD or DO) and complete residency where they learn to diagnose and treat mental illness. They are qualified to prescribe medicine.\nFor more severe disorders like major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, it is better to see a psychiatrist because you may need medicine to help manage your symptoms. Psychologists may turn their patients over to a psychiatrist if they believe the patient may better benefit from medicine (which can change the brain chemicals).\n2. **Consider the types of treatment offered.** Psychologists and psychiatrists can also take different approaches to the treatment of mental health issues. Due to their training, psychologists mainly offer psychological analysis and counseling. Since psychiatrists train as medical doctors first, they can also order blood tests and complete physical exams to connect mental health issues with biological problems.\n\nPsychologists use techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy to help patients cope with problems and to overcome mental health issues.\nPsychologists can also provide psychological assessments.\nThey may look into your sleep patterns, your eating habits, and other aspects of your life to pinpoint the problem.\nPsychiatrists look at your mental state but also your physical health.\nThey may order tests to determine whether your symptoms are related to underlying physical conditions.\n3. **Decide if you want medication therapy.** One of the major differences between psychiatrists and psychologists is that psychiatrists can prescribe medication, like antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedatives, and mood stabilizers. For example, a psychiatrist can treat depression with talk therapy alongside tests to see whether there is a physical issue, such as a thyroid problem, that may be causing your symptoms. \n\nA psychiatrist may prescribe a medication that will treat your specific condition.\nFor example, a psychiatrist may prescribe antidepressants to treat depression, Ritalin for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or antipsychotic medications for hallucinations.\nPsychiatrists, in the same way, can order medical tests and therapies that aren’t available to psychologists.\nFor instance, they can use electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) for conditions like severe depression, mania, and catatonia.\nPsychologists rely mostly on talk and behavioral therapy to help you come to terms with issues and to cope.\nThey are not normally licensed to prescribe medicine, but psychologists in Louisiana, New Mexico, and Illinois who have received the appropriate pharmacological training are permitted to prescribe certain medications.\n4. **Plan on going through talk therapy.** Psychologists and psychiatrists can use talk therapy, but psychologists may rely on this treatment method more since medication is not usually part of the treatment options that they offer. Talk therapy can be quite effective and some people seem to prefer counseling to other treatment options.\n\nTherapy has also been found to be as effective as medications in some situations, but medication may still be necessary in conjunction with talk therapy.\n\nTherefore, if you choose to see a psychiatrist, then you may need to see a therapist in addition to seeing a psychiatrist.\nSome psychiatrists operate medication only practices, while others offer medication and talk therapy.\nIf the psychiatrist you are considering offers medication only, then you will need to seek talk therapy from a different mental health professional.\nIf the psychiatrist offers medication and talk therapy, then you can see the psychiatrist for talk therapy.\nKeep in mind that talk therapy is essential because even though medication can be helpful, medication alone is not enough to change the way you deal with your emotions.\n\nTalk therapy can allow you resolve conflicts with loved ones or a spouse, work through anxiety, relieve stress, cope with major changes in life, manage unhealthy behavior like anger, or deal with sexual problems.\nMany people also prefer talk therapy with a psychologist to medicine and a psychiatrist’s “pharmacologic” treatment.\nThis may be because they fear becoming addicted to meds or don’t want to change their brain chemistry.\n5. **Talk to your doctor.** Talk to your primary care doctor about whether a psychologist or psychiatrist is right for you. There are some important considerations to make, including what kind of mental health issue you’re facing, what sort of treatment is available, and what sort of treatment you prefer. Your doctor can help you make an informed decision.\nYou may also need a referral from your doctor to see a mental health professional. Check with your health insurance to determine what the requirements are.\n6. **Weigh the pros and cons of insurance and access.** Many insurance plans now cover psychological and psychiatric services and must, by law, treat them on equal footing with other medical coverage. However, that doesn’t mean that insurance will cover your visits, and they may only cover a certain number of visits per year. You’ll need to check your coverage before making a final decision.\n\nLegally, insurance companies can’t charge you higher co-pays for mental health services than for medical services. However, they can limit your ability to access psychologists and psychiatrists in other ways.\nMany insurance companies haven’t increased payment rates for psychologists and psychiatrists in 10 to 20 years, or have even cut them.\nThis means that many networks have trouble attracting mental health specialists.\nYou may, therefore, have to pay more out of pocket and then claim the visit as an “out-of-network service.”\nInsurance companies can also make you get “prior authorization” before accessing psychiatric services like inpatient treatment, even in emergencies like having suicidal thoughts.\nThe doctor will have to get this from the insurer before you can be admitted as a patient.\nMake sure to talk to your doctors as well as your insurer to see what services are covered, how you can access them, and what the potential costs are.\n7. **Ask questions.** When you call to make your first appointment, you can ask questions about the psychiatrist or psychologist’s experience and area of expertise to help you make your decision. For example, you might ask:\n\nHow long have you been practicing?\nI have been struggling with ___. Is this something that you have experience treating? What types of treatment do you use?\nHow much do you charge for each session?\nDo you accept my insurance?",

         "How to Start Your Christmas Shopping Early",
         "Early Christmas shopping saves all that last-minute rushing around. If you have a plan set you can be more effective, save money, and enjoy the Christmas season more.\n1. **Know who you are buying gifts for.** Some people only shop for close family and friends. Other people put together Christmas presents for co-workers, the postal worker, the dog walker, hairdresser, plumber, poker buddies, kid's teacher, and more. Decide on what you are comfortable with.\n2. **Set a budget.** Christmas presents should figure into your household or personal budget for the entire year, instead of just trying to find extra money somehow every November or December. You can always start by saving a small amount every month.\nKeep a general idea of how much you will spend on each person. For instance, you will likely spend more money on your immediate family than on a co-worker.\n3. **Decide on what sort of gift matches each person on your list.** What do they like? Movies, books, games? Have a rough idea of what presents would please the people on your list. brainstorm ideas. Write the ideas down on your list. Listen to the person or other people for ideas, and write them down too. Keep this list in an easy-to-carry form, like tucked away in your wallet or checkbook for quick reference.\n4. **Start as early as the day following Christmas day.** There's no point in buying early if you're going to buy for full price. Christmas shopping can start December 26th. Although you may feel the last thing you want to do is shop after the Christmas rush, stores often have incredible sales immediately after the holidays, and most items will be perfectly good gifts the next year.\n\nCheck out sales throughout the year, such as at the end of summer.\nAfter-Christmas and Boxing Day sales are a good time to pick up wrapping paper and the like for the next year for a pittance.\n5. **Put off procrastinating.** Many people end up shopping last-minute because they put off the inevitable. Instead, make a plan with solid goals, dates, and timelines.\nFor instance, shopping will be done by December 20th. Put aside two evenings, twice a week for 2 weeks to accomplish this task. Leave some wiggle-room in case something comes up, but don't keep making excuses. It can help to have someone who is good about shopping to keep you on track.\n6. **Have a shopping plan.** Maybe you're not the type of person who likes shopping, or don't have the time to browse for Christmas presents all year long. Instead, put aside one period of time, like a weekend or a special shopping trip.\n7. **Keep track of presents.** Don't lose the present or forget who you bought it for.\n\nHave a designated area for presents, such as a tote, section of closet, or attic. Be sure that the present won't be ruined by variations of temperature, humidity, mold, mice, and so on.\nWrite the name of the designated gift-receiver on a removable sticker or piece of tape. That way you'll remember who you bought it for. If you change your mind, it's easy to re-designate. Cross their name off the list as soon as possible to avoid forgetting that you already bought them something.\n8. **Hide the gifts well.** Hiding is the hardest part of buying a gift early, but it's perfectly possible. If you live with the person, hide it in your craft cupboard, toy box, the back of a wardrobe, etc. and leave it inside backpacks or other opaque bags. It's best to choose somewhere the other person is not likely to look.\n9. **Know what you're having for the Christmas meal at least a month in advance.** This will allow you to start buying the foodstuffs and drinks that are on sale and aren't perishable. Write it all out on a list, then list the ingredients separately. From the ingredients list, highlight all the foods that can be bought early, such as canned foods, long life foods and dried foods. All of these can be bought well ahead of Christmas, perhaps in November.\nMake storage space. Check the freezer, pantry and refrigerator for space that can be spared to contain all of the Christmas goodies you're purchasing ahead of time.\n10. **Start looking for liquor and soft drink sales at least one month ahead.** Stock up well ahead of the rush. Dealing with drinks early is a great way to buy yourself more time when Christmas Day approaches––no long lines for you.\nStore these out of the way in the basement, pantry floor or other area where they won't be disturbed or subject to temperature extremes.\n11. **Purchase the ingredients for the cake and pudding as soon as you see the ingredients go on sale in November.** Many stores stock up additional amounts of dried fruits, flour, spices, etc. and put sales on early to get the stock moving. Since a cake and pudding are best made a month before Christmas to give them time to cure, start looking for the sales on the ingredients early November.\n12. **Purchase the non-perishable food items from mid-November through to mid-December.** Having these tucked away in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer in readiness for use will take a great weight off your mind. Non-perishables that can be bought ahead include:\n\nNuts and Nibbles\nChips, pretzels, and crackers\nCanned foods\nFrozen foods, including frozen desserts\nCandies and candied fruits\nIce cream\nSome root vegetables, pumpkins\nGingerbread and other spiced cookies\nCommercially made Christmas cake, puddings, mince pies\nLong-life milk, bread wraps, cookies, etc.\n13. **Order food well ahead of time.** Order meats, baked items, cakes, desserts, etc. from the relevant providers at the end of November into early December. Get an emailed or texted confirmation of your order and always call ahead a few days prior to pick-up date to check that the order has not been mislaid and is underway. Collect the day before Christmas or Christmas morning, as relevant. Although you still have to shop at Christmas-time, pre-ordering removes the stress of last-minute thinking and ensures that the provider of the goods has the resources and time to service your order.\nMake things easier by having a family member do all the pick-ups. Provide them with a list and locations for pickups, then send them on their way.\n14. **Buy perishable supermarket foods two days before Christmas.** This avoids the pre-Christmas day rush that is usually full of all the people who forgot to be organized. If there is anything that must be bought fresh the day before or on the day, add that to the pre-orders––even many supermarkets will take pre-orders for things such as meats and baked goods.\nStore everything in one part of the refrigerator or use a second one if you have another.",

         "How to Exercise the Right Side of Your Brain",
         "Many people believe that the left side of the brain is more analytical and logical, while the right side is more intuitive and creative, but scientific research indicates that this contention is oversimplified and inaccurate. Even if you most likely can’t unlock your creative side by specifically exercising your “right brain,” however, exercising your brain in general is a good thing. And, engaging in creative activities certainly can’t hinder the enhancement of your creative self.\n1. **Use the “Kitchen Sink” technique to encourage inspiration.** If you find yourself stuck with a problem (for instance, needing funds for a trip) and hoping for an “a-ha moment,” try exposing yourself to quick tidbits of information and then letting your mind relax. Read a paragraph or two from a half-dozen or more unrelated but engaging books, articles, or web pages, or listen to snippets from audiobooks or podcasts. Then, do a relaxing activity like taking a walk, gardening, or knitting for a half hour or so. Repeat the process as needed.\nSome people believe this method helps to jump-start brainstorming and can help you reach creative solutions faster. There’s no hard evidence for this, of course, but it can’t hurt to try!\n2. **Engage in “deep practice” of a creative skill.** You might also call this technique “failing productively,” as it involves jumping right into trying something new, exploring your shortcomings in relation to your ideal result, and trying again. For instance, if you wanted to take up painting, you’d:\n\nGrab some paints and a canvas and give painting your chosen landscape, still life, portrait, etc. your best shot.\nAccept that the finished result is almost certainly not the result you hope to achieve, and embrace this “failure” as an opportunity.\nCompare your actual result to the result you visualized beforehand.\nPractice some skill-building exercises, like taking a class, watching videos, or reading about painting techniques.\nRepeat the process over again until you feel you’ve reached the creative result you seek.\n3. **Give simple tasks a challenging spin.** For instance, you probably sign your name without thinking, but what if you try to sign it backwards? Or upside down? Or backwards and upside down? Practice challenging your creative mind until you can master all three.\n\nOr, try engaging both sides of your brain by writing a simple question to yourself (e.g., “What are you thinking about?”) with your right hand (which is controlled by the left side of your brain). Then, immediately switch the pen to your left hand (controlled by the right side of your brain) and write the first answer that comes to you (e.g., “Eating an ice cream cone on a park bench”).\nThere’s no empirical evidence that any of these kinds of tasks will actually make you more creative, but they will certainly exercise your brain and your motor skills!\n4. **Breathe through your left nostril to activate your brain’s right side.** There is some evidence out there—although it’s not supported by rigorous science—that focusing your breathing on your left nostril stimulates the right side of your brain, the supposed source of your creativity. It’s worth a try!\nNo doubt this technique sounds strange, but most people naturally go through a “nasal cycle” in which they switch breathing through individual nostrils every several hours throughout the day. This is why one nostril at a time often gets stuffed up during a cold.\n5. **Scan your eyes back and forth to stimulate your whole brain.** Focus on an object in your left eye’s field of vision, and another object in your right eye’s field. Then scan both eyes back and forth between them for 30 seconds or more. The theory here is that this exercise will activate and integrate both sides of your brain.\nThis method is scientifically unproven, but the worst case scenario is that you might get a bit dizzy trying it!\n6. **Laugh more and embrace positivity.** While there isn’t hard scientific evidence to support it, it’s possible that positive thinking, and laughter in particular, may help stimulate the areas of your brain associated with creativity. In theory, stimulating these areas may strengthen their neural pathways and thereby strengthen your “creative side.”\nAnd, even if it doesn’t boost your creativity, being happy is good for your mental and physical health anyway!\n7. **Allow yourself to daydream and doodle.** Few people can be creative on demand. Rather, it’s more effective to let your mind wander and be ready to make the most of a creative impulse when it hits you.\nImagining silly things or drawing incomprehensible sketches may seem like a waste of time, but it’s often during these moments when the proverbial light bulb comes on.\n8. **Experience life mindfully.** Instead of trying to force your brain into creativity, focus on your surroundings and in-the-moment experiences. Observe the scenery around you carefully. Chew your food slowly and experience each bite. Be fully present in even the most mundane conversations.\nSome people believe that blocking out distractions and narrowing your focus will help you to “hear” your creative impulses when they come.\n9. **Draw or write about your dreams.** There’s still a lot of mystery when it comes to dreams. It can’t be denied that dreams are often very creative, though, so trying to capture this unconscious creativity may help you get in tune with your creativity when you’re awake as well.\nWhen you wake up, jot down or sketch out whatever you can remember about any dreams you had. Even if the dream doesn’t make much sense, there may be kernels of inspiration that will become apparent to you.\n10. **Be more spontaneous.** According to the popular concept, a left-brain dominant person is calculating, logical, and analytical. But we all have at least a small part of ourselves that is more intuitive and spontaneous. It’s possible that embracing your innate spontaneity may stimulate and “exercise” those same areas of your brain that relate to creativity.\nCall in sick and go skydiving. Walk up to that person and ask them out. Or just switch up from packing PB & J for lunch every day!\n11. **Learn to play a musical instrument.** Playing a guitar, piano, saxophone, or other instrument requires both a logical attention to detail and an intuitive “feel” for the music. This combination of precision and improvisation makes playing music a great whole-brain exercise.\n12. **Try brain-training puzzles, games, and activities.** There are countless apps and programs out there that claim brain-boosting benefits, but many of the claims are dubious or at least not well supported at present. That said, even if challenging your brain with puzzles, games, and so on may not necessarily provide the specific claimed benefits, there’s certainly no detriment to giving your brain regular workouts.\nDon’t feel as though you need to spend large sums of money on brain-boosting programs, though. You can find many free or low cost options online, and traditional options like crosswords and jigsaw puzzles will give your brain a workout as well.\n13. **Keep your brain active.** Simple activities like reading a book, engaging in a conversation, or doing a hobby put your brain to work. And, while there’s still a lot of research to be done, it seems as though active brains are more likely to remain healthy and vital for longer.\nFocus on active brain engagement—reading instead of watching TV, going to a cooking class instead of watching a cooking video, putting together furniture instead of buying it pre-assembled, and so on.\n14. **Exercise** What’s good for your body is good for your brain. Talk to your doctor, a dietician, and/or an athletic trainer if you need advice about developing healthier routines in your daily life.\n\nTry to sleep for 7-9 hours per night (as an adult).\nAim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.\nEat lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, and drink more water.",

         "How to Celebrate Diwali",
         "Diwali is the Festival of Lights, a 5-day celebration to honor the triumph of good over evil and new beginnings. In 2023, Diwali goes from November 10th to the 15th, with each day carrying its own special meanings and traditions. Celebrating Diwali means decking your house in lights and colors, giving Diwali cards to your family and friends, spending time with your loved ones, and enjoying delicious food together.\n1. **Clean your house on or before the first day of Diwali.** Diwali is the Hindu New Year, and it’s a celebration of new beginnings. It’s traditional to clean up your home and business on or before the first day of Diwali as a kind of cleansing ritual, preparing yourself for a fresh new start. Do your laundry, neaten up cluttered areas, and sort out bills and paperwork.\nThink of this cleaning as a way to purify your environment and make way for the fresh, positive energy of Diwali and the new year.\n2. **Draw footprints to scatter through your home on the first day.** The first day of Diwali, Dhanteras, is a day to celebrate Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. A traditional way of awaiting her arrival is to trace small footprints throughout your house. You sprinkle a mixture of rice flour and vermillion powder directly on the floor, or draw footprints on paper, cut them out, and place them around the house.\n3. **Shop for new clothes, jewelry, and utensils.** Another tradition at the beginning of Diwali is to go shopping for new clothes and household items, like kitchen utensils and decorations. Try to buy at least a couple new items of clothing and kitchen tools to wear and use during Diwali, another way of celebrating the fresh start of a year.\nFor example, you could buy a few new shirts or pants, a nice set of plates or utensils, or some jewelry.\n4. **Decorate your home** Narak Chaturdashi, the second day of Diwali, is typically when people adorn their homes with bright, colorful rangoli designs. Sketch out your design on a piece of transparent parchment paper, then sprinkle sand or dried rice over it. To add some color, buy colored rice or sand at a craft store or dye your materials using food coloring.\n\nRangoli is a traditional work of art and decoration done in sand or rice, often depicting beautiful, symmetrical flowers like lotuses and daisies.\nRangoli designs are typically placed just inside the entryway of your home, but feel free to set them up elsewhere, too.\nYou can also paint or draw your rangoli designs on paper or wood, or even buy them pre-made.\n5. **Light diyas and candles around your home, especially in the doorways.** Diyas are small oil lamps shaped like cups with cotton, candle-like wicks. To welcome the goddess Lakshmi into your home, it’s traditional to light 4-6 diyas in a row near the doorways, often around your rangoli designs. You can also use small tealights instead.\n\nDiyas and candles are often placed on the floor, but you may choose to place them up higher if you have pets or small children.\nDiwali is the Festival of Lights, so feel free to place candles and diyas in other places around your home as well!\nYou can buy diyas online and even decorate them with recycled materials.\n6. **Hang string lights around your home to make it bright and festive.** To celebrate the Festival of Lights, make your whole home bright! Hang string lights throughout your house, lining them along the walls and intertwining them through tables and mantels. You can also hang up lights outside, along your roof and fences.\nYou can hang plain white lights or go with colorful strings.\n7. **Make snacks and appetizers like kebabs and yogurt dip.** There’s no one traditional meal or type of food for Diwali, so feel free to experiment or go with your family’s old favorites. For snacks and appetizers, try options like dahi ke kebabs and yogurt dip with chips or bread.\n\nYou can make dahi ke kebabs by mixing together plain yogurt, chopped coriander, chopped green chilis, chopped onions, chickpea flour, and cumin seeds, then chilling them for an hour. Shape the mixture into flat circles and fry them in oil or butter until they’re brown on both sides.\nFor yogurt dip, you’ll combine a shredded, salted cucumber with whole milk yogurt, red onion, lime juice, and several spices.\n8. **Go with a masala dish for a simple, savory main course.** You can’t go wrong with a tasty masala for your main course. “Masala” stands for a mixture of spices often used in Indian cooking, and you can make lots of variations of it, including a vegetarian paneer butter masala, chickpea masala, or chicken tikka masala.\nTo make your masala, you’ll cook your main ingredient (either meal or vegetables) in a deep skillet with milk and spices like curry, coriander, and cumin.\n9. **Make pindi chole for a spicy dish.** Indian dishes are known for being spicy! If you want a little bit of kick on your menu, whip up some pindi chole, made by simmering a mix of spices and chickpeas in a thick, creamy sauce. To make pindi chole with chickpeas:\n\nCook pre-soaked garbanzo beans in a pressure cooker with 3 black tea bags until they’re cooked through, then drain the water.\nUsing a wok over medium heat, dry roast whole spices like black cumin, carrom seeds, and dry pomegranate until they’re browned, then grind them.\nSaute garlic ginger paste in the wok for a minute, then add green chilis, green cardamom, pepper, and a bay leaf. Add powdered spices like cumin, coriander powder, and dry mango powder and saute for 2 minutes.\nFinally, pour in the cooked beans and cook, covered, for 5-7 minutes. Add water and cook until its absorbed, 4-5 minutes, then serve!\n10. **Serve a creamy paneer makhani to add cheesy flavor.** Paneer makhani is a satisfying cheese dish that’s perfect for a Diwali celebration. Paneer is just an unsalted version of cottage cheese, so you can substitute it if you like. To make this dish:\n\nSaute red chillies, ginger, garlic paste, and whole spices like bay leaves, cinnamon, and cloves for 1-2 minutes in oil or butter. Add cashew nuts, poppy seeds, and onions and saute until the onions are translucent.\nAdd tomatoes and stir, then cover the pan and let it cook until the tomatoes start to break down. Set the mixture aside to cool. Then, remove as many whole spices as you can and use an immersion blender to blend it until it’s a smooth paste.\nIn the same pan, add butter, curry paste, garam masala powder, chili powder, turmeric, ketchup, salt, and water. Bring it to a boil, then lower it to a simmer for 30 minutes.\nCut the paneer into bite-sized pieces and stir it into the mix.\n11. **Serve bread like naan on the side.** This flat, Indian-style bread is a favorite for all ages. It’s the perfect side to nibble on or calm down your taste buds after a spicy dish. You can make your own naan or buy it in a store. Heat it in the microwave or a toaster first to make sure its warm!\n12. **Include plenty of sweets and pastries, like barfi and pudding.** As tasty as all the other dishes are, desserts are the star during Diwali! Serve your favorite pastries and sweets, like barfi, a creamy treat made by cooking condensed milk, sugar, and nuts until they solidify, then cut and served in squares. You can also try a dish like kheer, prepared with blanched almonds and raisins and enhanced with some saffron, or a traditional peda.\nYou can try your own hand at making these dishes, or cater from a local Indian restaurant.\n13. **Invite family and friends over on the third day of Diwali.** No Diwali celebration is complete without spending time with your loved ones. If you can’t spend time together on each day of Diwali, try to get together on the third day, which is considered the most significant day of the festival. Invite them over to enjoy a meal and some sweets, then take the time to catch up and enjoy each other’s company.\n\nOn the third day, many families also gather together for Lakshmi puja, a prayer to the goddess Lakshmi as well as Ganesh, the god of wisdom, and Kuber, the lord of wealth.\n\nIf you’re away for Diwali, text your family and friends to wish them a good celebration and tell them how much you love them!\n14. **Light sparklers together.** Fireworks, firecrackers, and sparklers are always a big part of Diwali, especially on the third day, bringing together the festive spirit and bright, colorful lights of the holiday. If you can, buy handheld sparklers to light outside and enjoy with friends and family. Swirl them carefully in the air to make pretty designs and effects!\nSetting off private fireworks and firecrackers is illegal in most regions.\n15. **Exchange gifts on the fourth day.** Padwa, the fourth day of Diwali, is the official first day of the new year! On this day, it’s traditional to visit your family and friends to exchange gifts and greetings. The gifts don’t have to be anything big—many families give sweets or small items. The most important part is simply appreciating each other.\n16. **Celebrate with siblings for the final day of Diwali.** Bahu-dooj, the fifth and last day of the festival, is dedicated to the bond between siblings. Traditionally, brothers will visit their sisters, who will put a “tilak,” or vermilion mark, on their forehead to symbolize their love. Brothers, meanwhile, will give their sisters gifts, goodies, and blessings.\nIf you can, visit your siblings in-person or give them a call to check in and show your love for each other.\n17. **Join in at public Diwali celebrations.** Diwali is celebrated all over the world. Even if you can’t be at one of the big celebrations in India, Singapore, and other South Asian countries, there are typically celebrations in most major metropolitan areas. Look online for festivities near you and head out to watch fireworks, enjoy sweet and savory treats, and take part in the celebration!\nThe U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia all have large Diwali celebrations.",

         "How to Break in Your Brand New Dr Martens Boots",
         "When you think about breaking in tough, leather Dr. Martens, you may experience an instinctive shudder as you get ready to stock up on band-aids and live with a few blisters. But stretching your new shoes doesn't have to be painful! There are several relatively easy and pain-free processes to made sure your shoes fit just the way they should. Here are several break-in methods to choose from that you too can do from the comfort of home!\n1. **Start with thick socks.** Put on socks that will both push the leather outwards and protect your feet from any rubbing or pinching. This will prevent the formation of irritating blisters.\n2. **Wear the shoes for 10 minutes.** Keep the shoes on long enough that they begin to mold to your feet, but not so long that they cause pain or injury. Walk around and stretch your feet while your wear them.\n\nDo this whenever you have free time to change shoes and walk around. Try to do this at least two to three times per day.\nTo find the time to switch between your comfy shoes and the Dr. Martens you’re breaking in, wear your new boots before, after, or during the lunch break of your work day.\n3. **Increase your shoe-wearing time in ten-minute increments.** Slowly expand the amount of time you keep your shoes on your feet, paying close attention to how your feet feel. Don’t push through the pain; take them off if you start to feel any discomfort. \n\nBecause this is a slower and more time-consuming method, plan ahead. If you want to show off your new Dr. Martens at a particular event, begin this process about a month before that date.\nTry to wear your Dr. Martens around the house as much as you can (without causing yourself pain).\n4. **Manually stretch the leather.** Bending the leather in the direction it goes in when you're wearing your boots can help break them in. Bend the back of the shoe inwards to make the heel area more spacious, then push the toe to and away from the laces. You can also bend the leather in and out on the instep (or the middle, by the laces) of the shoe. \n\nThis may cause creasing in the leather. To avoid noticeable or permanent creases, be sure your leather is properly conditioned before you use your hands to stretch it. Dr. Martens' has its own product, Wonder Balsam, for this purpose, however, other brands should work just fine as well.\nPeriodically conditioning your boots will also aid in the overall break-in process. Soft and supple leather is much easier to stretch than stiff leather.\n5. **Keep the shoes stretched even when they’re off your feet.** Stuff your shoes with some newspaper or a shoe tree to make sure they don’t shrink back down when you’re not wearing them. If you use newspaper, be sure to fully stuff the shoe.\n6. **Take your boots on an outing.** Once you can comfortably wear your Dr. Martens for an hour, they should be fully broken in. Test the fit on a walk or excursion that allows you to come home and change shoes if necessary.\nIf you’re worried, bring an extra pair of reliable shoes along with you.\n7. **Pour water into a resealable freezer bag.** Fill the bag no more than halfway to avoid spills or tears.\n\nBe aware of the areas of your boot that need the most stretching, as this may alter how much water you place in the bag. If it’s a smaller or larger portion, fill the bag with the amount of water that makes it fit comfortably within that space.\nUse a high-quality plastic bag. You don’t want any water to touch the leather directly, as this will damage your boots. Choosing a bag specifically for freezer use will help ensure that no leaking occurs.\n8. **Seal the bag.** Leaving only a small corner of the bag unsealed, remove the excess air from the unfilled half of the bag, and then fully seal the bag. Double check for leaks, tears, or an incomplete seal.\nJust in case you’ve spilled a bit of water while filling or sealing the bag, wipe it off with a dishcloth or paper towel.\n9. **Place the bag in your shoe.** Check to make sure that the bag presses against the area(s) of the shoe that need to be stretched.\n\nUse crumpled newspaper to keep the bag in position.\nYou can use several bags of varying sizes to fill the various portions of your shoe. The toe, in particular, may call for a smaller bag that fully touches the entire front of the shoe.\n10. **Freeze the boot.** Put your boot, complete with the filled bag of water, into your freezer. Leave the boots in the freezer for a minimum of eight hours, or overnight. The water should be completely frozen before you remove the shoes, as the expanding ice is what stretches the leather.\n11. **Let the boots thaw.** Once you remove your boots from the freezer, wait twenty minutes up to an hour before you remove the bags. The ice needs time to melt and soften a bit so that you’re not forcing the bag out of the shoe. Taking the bag out too early may tear the bag, spilling the water that will damage your boot.\n12. **Remove the bag.** Be very careful not to tear the bag as you pull it out of your boot.\n13. **Check the fit.** If your boots are still too tight, repeat the process, focusing your attention on the problem areas.\n14. **Put on thick socks.** You want the boots to feel tight, so use woolen or winter socks.\n15. **Wear your boots** You may need to force your feet to fit into the boots, and this won't be the most comfortable experience. Without a tight fit, however, the leather won’t have any reason to stretch or expand.\nIf the boots still feel loose, try putting on two or three pairs of socks at once.\n16. **Break out your hair dryer.** Keeping the hair dryer about six inches away from the shoe, blow hot air on the tight areas of the boots for about 30 seconds, flexing your feet and wiggling your toes as you go.\nEach problem spot should receive its own 30-second heat treatment.\n17. **Let the boots cool.** Keep wearing your new shoes until they’ve cooled down, walking around and flexing your foot as you wait. The boots should be about room temperature to the touch before you remove them, otherwise you’ll negate the heating process.\n18. **Check the fit.** You may need to repeat this method several times, paying close attention to which spots need the most attention. Focus the heat treatment on those areas.\nTry wearing a thicker pair of socks if you find it necessary to repeat the steps. It’s possible your fit wasn’t tight enough to force the leather to stretch.\n19. **Condition your leather.** Heat removes moisture from the leather, which may cause cracks or breaks in the shoes. Avoid this side effect by applying products designed to restore moisture and keep the leather supple, such as Dr. Martens Wonder Balsam.",

         "How to Buy Citric Acid",
         "Citric acid is available for purchase through many different types of stores. Where you choose to buy citric acid depends on what you plan to use it for and how much you wish to purchase. Citric acid is a weak acid naturally found in citrus fruits that individuals and manufacturers often use because of its preservative and chelating properties and sour taste. Citric acid is important for canning, cheese-making, homebrewing, and candy making, and is an ingredient in some recipes and beverages to regulate acidity. People also use citric acid for craft projects such as fizzing bath salts, or may be interested in purchasing citric acid for laboratory experiments. You can buy citric acid in either anhydrous (water-free) or in monohydrate form.\n1. **Determine how much citric acid you need to buy.** The amount you need will determine where you should shop for citric acid. Smaller quantities can generally be purchased at the grocery store, while larger quantities may need be purchased at a bulk store or online.\n\nConsult the instructions for your activity or recipe to see how much citric acid they indicate you need to use for your project.\nIncrease the amount of citric acid if you plan to make multiple batches of a recipe or want to have an ample amount for repeating the activity. For example, if you plan to use citric acid for cheese-making, and you want to make your own cheese on a regular basis, you will want to buy enough citric acid for multiple uses.\n2. **Look for citric acid at your local supermarket.** Food grade citric acid is normally available in a powder form. Typically, it is best to buy citric acid at a grocery store when you need a small amount, for example, a bottle with 3 to 5 ounces (85 g to 142 g).\n\nCheck for citric acid in the canning section. It is often located near the pectin and other canning ingredients and materials.\n\nLook for citric acid under the name sour salt in the kosher section or in the spice aisle.\n3. **Check natural food stores for citric acid.** Health food stores often carry citric acid and may have a greater range of sizes available than standard grocery stores. Call the store before stopping by to make sure they have the amount you need in stock.\n4. **Shop at a restaurant supply store.** Restaurant supply stores, especially baking or candy-making supply stores, are likely to carry citric acid. These types of stores will likely have quantities available in bulk as well. If you need a large amount, check here first.\nPlan to purchase at least 1 pound (.45 kg) of citric acid. Smaller quantities may not be available.\n5. **Find a store that sells home brewing supplies.** Homebrewers often use citric acid, for example to adjust to acid level in fruit wines. A store that caters to home brewers may also have knowledgeable staff that can provide detailed information on how to use citric acid for your particular project.\n6. **Shop online.** Online retailers sell small to large containers of citric acid and many online stores sell it by the pound. You can skip the shopping and have the citric acid delivered right to your door. If you are using the citric acid in something that will be consumed, remember to order food grade citric acid.\nTake into account that shipping costs may make it more expensive to buy citric acid online than at a local restaurant supply or warehouse store. However, online prices are generally more competitive than supermarket prices per ounce.\n7. **Choose which form of citric acid you want to purchase.** Citric acid is available as a monohydrate and in anhydrous form. Anhydrous means there is no water, so the citric acid is more powdery than the monohydrate form that has water.\n\nAnhydrous citric acid is usually used in bath bombs, but the monohydrate form will also work.\nUnless the project specifies the use of one form over the other, either one should work.\n8. **Check craft stores for citric acid.** Anhydrous citric acid may be available in the soap-making section of craft stores as it is a common ingredient in fizzing bath bombs. Call the store before going there to make sure they have the quantity in stock you need.\n9. **Buy citric acid through a chemical supply company.** A chemical supply source will provide the greatest number of options in terms of grade, texture, quantity, and form. Read through your supplier's definitions of the grades they sell. Many suppliers also create their own grade labels to indicate the quality of the chemical. Citric acid is available in different grades including:\n\nFood Chemical Codex (FCC)- food grade\nAmerican Chemical Society (ACS) grade- the substance meets the standards set forth by the ACS for reagent chemicals in their publication.\n\nUnited States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade- a substance that meets the specifications in the \"Reagents, Indicators and Solutions\" section of the USP.",

         "How to Make Homemade Popsicles",
         "There's nothing more refreshing than a popsicle on a hot summer's day. Next time you need an icy fix, don't wait for the ice cream truck to roll around! Make a batch of popsicles yourself. Whether you love fresh berry popsicles, chocolate popsicles, orange creamsicles or soda popsicles, wikiHow has you covered!\n1. **Wash and process your fruit.** Make sure your blueberries, raspberries and strawberries are rinsed and clean. Remove the strawberries' stems and chop them into bite-sized pieces.\n2. **Make a simple syrup.** Place the water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium low heat. Heat the mixture, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves into the water. Remove it from heat and set it aside.  You now have a tasty syrup to sweeten your popsicles.\n\nFor a minty fresh flavor, add some mint leaves to the mixture as it cooks, then take them out before using the syrup.\nIf you don't want to make syrup, you can substitute any type of fruit juice instead.\n3. **Blend the berries and lemon juice.** Place the berries and lemon juice in a blender and blend until completely smooth. If you like chunks of fruit in your popsicles, you can leave some fruit out and stir it in after the mixture has been blended.\n4. **Stir in 1/3 cup simple syrup.** If you want your popsicles sweeter, you can add more simple syrup. You can also swap it out for grape juice, cranberry juice, lemon-lime soda, or any other sweet liquid.\n5. **Pour the mixture into popsicle molds.** This recipe will make six large popsicles. If you don't have popsicle molds you can  make mini popsicles using an ice cube tray!\n6. **Freeze the popsicles until they're hard.** Put them in the freezer and leave them alone for at least 3 hours or overnight, so they'll be nice and hard when you take them out to eat them.\n7. **Mix the milk and water in a bowl.** You can use any type of milk you want for these popsicles - whole milk, skim, goat's milk, coconut milk, almond milk, and so on. Stir your milk and water together.\nIf you want extra creamy popsicles, swap out the water for whole milk, half and half or heavy cream.\n8. **Stir in the cocoa, vanilla and sugar.** Pour the cocoa and sugar into the bowl and stir with a whisk until they are completely dissolved in your milk and water mixture.\n\nYou can substitute honey, stevia, agave nectar, or any other sweetener for the sugar.\nInstead of vanilla, try using almond extract, a few drops of peppermint extract, or another flavoring.\n9. **Pour the mixture into popsicle molds.** Get creative and use ice cube trays if you don't have popsicle molds.\n10. **Freeze the popsicles.** Let them stay in the freezer for 3 hours or overnight, until they're completely hard.\n11. **Zest an orange.** The bright, fresh flavor from these popsicles comes from the orange zest. Use a zester, microplane or grater to zest an orange until you've collected 1 tablespoon.\n12. **Blend the orange juice, ice cream and zest.** Place them all in a blender and blend until completely smooth.\n\nLemonade or grapefruit juice also taste delicious in popsicle form.\nYou can sub the orange juice for root beer if you want a root beer float-inspired concoction.\n13. **Pour the mixture into popsicle molds.** \n14. **Freeze the popsicles until they're solid.** It will take at least 3 hours. Resist the temptation to take them out before they're hard - these popsicles melt quite easily!\n15. **Blend the watermelon.** Skip this step if you already have juice.\n16. **Pour the juice into molds and freeze for at least 3 hours, preferably 1-10 days or so.** \n17. **Remove the popsicles.** \n18. **Enjoy your popsicle(s)!** \n19. **Finished.** \n20. **Choose the type of soda or drink you want to use.** This will be the flavor of your popsicle. You can choose lemonade, grape juice, Kool-Aid, or whatever else tickles your fancy.\n21. **Carefully pour the drink into molds.** Fill up each popsicle mold so it is almost full. If you don't have molds, you can use paper cups or ice cube trays.\nIf you're using an ice cube tray, you can create handles out of toothpicks. Put plastic wrap over the tray, and place two toothpicks into each cup. The toothpicks should have a small amount of space between them.\n22. **Let the popsicles freeze completely.** This may take a few hours.\n23. **Take out the tray when the popsicles are hard.** Once the popsicles have all completely solidified, remove the tray from the freezer. Do not tug on the toothpicks or stick, but instead press from the bottom of the cup to remove the popsicle.\n24. **Serve and enjoy.** What ever remainders you have, you can put back in the freezer until next time.\n25. **Mix the ice cream and milk in a blender on the blend setting.** Blend for about 5 seconds.\n26. **Pour the blended mixture into a popsicle mold.** Set the timer for 90:00 minutes. Place the mold in the freezer.\n27. **When you remove the molds from the freezer, don't just pull the sticks out, as that will ruin your popsicle.** Instead, run some warm water over the mold for a few seconds. Now pull out the stick and you'll have concocted a lovely milky, icy treat.",

         "How to Find Legitimate Banking Jobs in Canada",
         "Finding a legitimate banking job in Canada need not be difficult if you are prepared and know where to look. The field of banking offers challenging opportunities for individuals to work in a variety of positions within the finance industry. Jobs are available across a diverse area of expertise including an entry-level position as a bank teller as well as higher level positions such as auditors, analysts, senior management and investment advisers. Educational requirements as well as necessary experience will vary depending on the type of banking job that you are interested in.\n1. **Earn your high school diploma before you begin applying for bank jobs.** Most Canadian banking positions require a minimum of a high school diploma for entry-level work. This includes positions like a drive-through clerk or a teller.\n2. **Become a Canadian citizen to legally work in Canada.** You must meet certain legal obligations before being allowed to work in Canada. If you prefer not to become a citizen, you can become a permanent resident instead. Or apply for a temporary work permit, which allows you to work in Canada as a foreign citizen.\n\nIf you’re planning to permanently relocate to Canada before becoming a citizen, apply for a Canadian visa. A Temporary Resident Visa will allow you to live and work in Canada for an extended period of time. This document can also make it easier for you to become a full citizen of Canada.\nYou can start the application process for a Canadian visa online. Learn more here: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/apply-visitor-visa.html.\n3. **Pass a securities course if you plan to become an investment banker.** In Canada, there are a number of securities courses you can take. Once you’ve passed the course, you’ll be eligible to work as an investment banker. The primary securities course is the CSI’s Global Education’s Canadian Securities Course (CSC). You can also take a securities course offered by the Institute of Canadian Bankers.\n\nSecurities courses will familiarize you with Canadian financial services. They will also give you in-depth knowledge about banking-industry practices like assessing company performance and understanding industry standards. You can choose between courses that let you specialize in areas including investment management and financial planning. Find out more about the CSI’s CSC course at: https://www.csi.ca/student/en_ca/courses/csi/csc.xhtml.\nIf you’re only planning to work as a bank teller, you won’t need to pass these exams.\n4. **Earn a BA in a finance-related field to make yourself hirable.** Investment banks like to hire young people with Bachelor’s degrees in fields that directly prepare them for working in a banking environment. While a generic business degree may suffice, you’ll be a more competitive candidate if you earn a degree directly related to banking. These fields include:\n\nFinance\nBusiness Administration\nEconomics\nAccounting\n5. **Apply for a banking internship** If you are currently a college student, look into opportunities for a position within a bank through an internship or work co-op. Internships and work co-ops often lead to full-time job offers once you graduate school. Contact your college career academic adviser if you are currently a student to help you in making arrangements for an internship within a bank in Canada.\n\nMany Canadian banks offer summer programs as well as scholarships for college students seeking to gain valuable skills and acquire some knowledge in the banking industry while still in school.\nMost colleges and universities get actively involved in placing students within internships, setting up appointments, and arranging interviews.\n6. **Earn a Master’s in Finance for a career as an investment banker.** A Master’s in Finance is a 2- or 3-year graduate program that prepares you to work in a financial field or institution. Through your graduate courses, you’ll be able to find out about banking internships and jobs. This is a great way to get your foot in the door of a bank.\nIn general, a Master’s in Finance will make you a better-qualified candidate for all types of banking jobs. If you’re considering going back to school and want to work in banking, a MF is the way to go.\n7. **Network by reaching out to personal and professional contacts.** Networking is a great way to make personal connections that can lead to Canadian banking jobs. Networking face-to-face removes much of the impersonality of online job applications.\n\nFor example, if you have a friend of a friend who manages a bank in Ottawa, ask your friend if they could set up a coffee meeting between you and the bank manager.\nEither an undergrad program in business or a Master’s in Finance will also provide you with plenty of opportunities to network with banking professionals and hiring managers.\n8. **Look for banking jobs at a local job fair.** Job fairs are a great way for companies—including banks—to find interested and qualified applicants. A job fair will also allow you to speak with several hiring banks in a single afternoon. You can ask the bank representatives how many positions they’re hiring for, how many branches are hiring, and what types of positions need to be filled.\nTo find information about upcoming local job fairs, search online for something like, “job fairs near me.” For a more banking-specific search, look for “banking job fairs in my area.”\n9. **Browse online boards to look for jobs in the Canadian banking industry.** Popular job-search websites include LinkedIn, Monster, and Indeed. Expand your search to include the subject of “finance” and “investment,” as openings may be listed under several categories. Make notations and bookmark those links with the best prospects.\n\nFor example, check out the listings of banking jobs through the Canadian website Hays.\nOr, if you’re looking for jobs in a specific city (e.g., Toronto), you could scan the CareerBuilder banking jobs listing for that city.\nYou could also browse the banking listings at Indeed for Toronto or other major cities.\n10. **Find job listings on the websites of reputable banks in Canada.** Read about the companies and the type of work that they do, and check for possible openings for banking jobs. Look for a menu button that says “Career” or “Jobs.” Keep a listing of those companies that provide some promising opportunities for a banking job so that you can revisit them later to apply for a position.\n\nFor example, check out job listings online for the Royal Bank of Canada at: https://www.rbc.com/careers/index.html.\nIf you’re interested, you could also check out the websites for finance and investment firms. While these aren’t technically banks, the work you’d do would likely be similar.\n11. **Apply to work in a rural bank if you don’t mind the commute.** About 1/3 of Canada’s banks are located in rural or small-town environments.  If you’re only considering working in a bank in a large city, you may be overlooking attainable banking jobs in less populated regions. So, in addition to searching online for jobs in major cities like Toronto or Montreal, look in smaller towns like Rainbow Lake, Alberta, or Toad River, BC.\nEven if you have to commute from a metropolitan area to a rural banking branch, it might be worth it to get your foot in the door at a Canadian bank.\n12. **Look for entry-level jobs if you don’t have much experience.** For example, you can apply to work as a bank teller or as an entry-level sales consultant. Also consider applying for data-entry clerk positions or for jobs as an administrative clerk. These jobs will help you gain necessary experience if you’d like to have a career in banking.\nYou’re technically eligible for most entry-level jobs with only a high-school diploma. However, if a bank has received many applications for low-level positions, having a bachelor’s degree will give you a competitive edge.\n13. **Find positions for managers if you’ve worked in banking before.** If you worked at a high level at a bank earlier in your career, plan to apply for bank management jobs. You’ll be especially competitive if you’ve earned an MBA or an MF.\nAs a bank manager, you would be overseeing dozens of bank employees, meeting with high-level clients, and ensuring that operations run smoothly.\n14. **Aim to find a job as an investment banker to invest in companies.** Investment bankers invest money in young start-up businesses and entrepreneurial ventures. In other instances, companies will hire an investment banker to purchase a smaller company or oversee a corporate merger.\nMost investment banker jobs require an MBA.\n15. **Search for a job as a financial analyst to work closely with investors.** Financial analysts help investors analyze stocks, bonds, and mutual funds in order to assemble the best possible investment portfolio. Most analysts specialize in understanding financial trends in a specific region (e.g., Korea) or for a specific type of business (e.g., pharmaceutical companies).\n\nIf you want to work with budgets specifically, look for work as a budget analyst. You’ll work to oversee the budgets of various corporations.\nSome analyst positions require an MBA.\n16. **Apply for a job as a loan officer to assess who receives a bank loan.** Loan officers work with potential loan recipients to determine which recipients are too high-risk and should be denied a loan. These jobs require you to look through large amounts of paperwork before extending loans to, for example, car buyers, house buyers, or college students.\nMost loan-officer positions do not require an MBA. The hiring managers may want you to have a bachelor’s degree in a business-related field, though.\n17. **Highlight your financial and banking experience on your resume.** Regardless of your level of experience, when applying for a banking job, focus on presenting your financial background. This includes information like college classes in finance and any prior work in a financial institution. There are different formats to follow when creating a resume, including chronological and functional. The best format for you will depend on your employment history as well as educational background.\n\nUse a chronological resume if you have several years of work experience as well as having graduated from high school or college. A chronological resume is formatted based on your history and includes specific dates for employment and training.\nChoose a functional resume if you do not have a great deal of work experience and are still in college or have just recently graduated. A functional resume will highlight your skills and abilities and focus less on past work experience.\n18. **Submit applications to your top 5–7 banking jobs.** Once you’ve reviewed a number of banking job postings online, narrow your list down to 5-7 jobs that you feel you’d enjoy and know you’re qualified for. All of the jobs you’re applying for should be in the same banking industry (e.g., investment banking). Visit the bank’s application portal, and fill in your personal and professional information as requested.\n\nThe application will comprise your resume describing your work and education history, a 1-page cover letter, and professional or academic references.\nYou should be able to apply for nearly all positions online. Some positions at older banks may request that you mail in a paper copy of your application and resume.\n19. **Prepare to answer questions about Canadian finance in the interview.** Questions will differ from bank to bank and will depend on the position you’re applying for. But, most questions will deal with your knowledge of the banking industry, customer service experience (for teller positions), knowledge of economics, and knowledge of loans and interest rates.\n\nFor example, the interviewer(s) may ask you about your knowledge of current financial events, recent turns on the stock markets, and your personal abilities with banking or programming software. They may also ask you to clarify aspects of your resume.\n\nMany Canadian banking companies do interviews in person and over Skype. You may be able to choose which format you prefer.\n20. **Follow up promptly after interviews.** Send a short thank-you email to the bank representative(s) that met and spoke with you. Briefly mention your desire to work for the company and that you believe that you have the qualifications and necessary experience to successfully do the job. Be enthusiastic but also professional in your tone and your approach.\nFor example, you could write, “Thank you for taking the time to interview me last Monday. I appreciated the time to speak face-to-face. I hope you’ll consider me for the position. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!”",

         "How to Straighten Out a Dollar Bill",
         "Have you ever been rejected by a candy machine because your dollar was too wrinkly? Or maybe you want every dollar bill in your money clip to be as smooth and flat as the day it was printed? Here are a few quick fixes for taking the folds out of those bills.\n1. **Place your dollar on a flat surface.** The ironing board is the most logical place to iron your bill. If you don’t have an ironing board, you can use a nearby table, but make sure to place a shirt or other linen on the ironing area so that you don’t burn the table.\n2. **Moisten the bill with water.** Spray a little water onto the dollar bill. You can do this with the spray function featured on the iron itself. Moisture helps remove those particularly pesky wrinkles during ironing.\nIf you don’t have an iron with a spray function, use a spray bottle or run the bill under a sink that is set to low pressure.\n3. **Turn your iron down to the lowest heat.** The goal is to dry the moisture out of the bill with the lowest heat necessary. Higher heat settings run the risk of damaging the dollar bill.\n4. **Iron** Use straight movements from one direction to the other. Repeat this a few times until the bill no longer appears to further flatten.\n\nTake care to avoid ironing folds into the bill. If you are having trouble getting the bill to lay flat, place it flat inside of a shirt. This will keep the bill weighed down flat while still allowing you to iron the bill.\nStart ironing the bill as your iron is still heating up. This is particularly helpful if your iron's lowest setting is still particularly hot.\n5. **Let the bill cool for 60 seconds.** The bill will be very hot to the touch immediately after ironing, so be careful! After the bill has cooled, you may flip the bill and repeat the ironing process on the new side of the bill.\nYou may reapply some moisture to the other side of the bill if it still has a large amount of folds or wrinkles.\n6. **Store flat for safe keeping.** Once you are satisfied that the bill cannot get any flatter, you are finished. Pick up your newly flattened bill and place alongside the others in your wallet.\n7. **Hold the crumpled bill at each end.** You want to hold the bill as straight as possible between both of your fingers. Hold it taut, but take care not to accidentally pull the bill apart in your hands.\n8. **Run the dollar bill against a cornered surface.** Make sure the entire surface of the bill is firmly dragged across the edge of where two planes meet. The goal is to force the wrinkles and folds out of the bill.\n\nThe corner of a vending machine is a convenient place to try this method, given that the vending machine likely wouldn’t accept your bill in the first place. However, any edged surface will do, including wall, desk or table corners.\nIf the corner you are using doesn’t seem to be straightening out the bill, try using a corner with a more inclined or sharper edge.\n9. **Flip the dollar in your hands and corner the other side.** If you only run one side of the bill against a corner, you run the risk of creating new folds or bends in the direction you were applying force to the bill. Flip the bill and run the opposite face across the corner same as you did to the first in order to create as much parity as possible.\n10. **Check the corners of your dollar bill.** It’s difficult to straighten the corners of the bill out using the edge of a wall. When you are done straightening the body of the bill, check the corners for “dog ears,” or small bends at the corners of the bill. If a dog ear is present, fold and crease the ear in the opposite direction to try to level out the bend (similar to removing creases from rugs or cloth).\n11. **Repeat until flattened.** Repeat the whole process until the darned vending machine takes your dollar bill. If the machine continues to reject the bill, you might have to use another bill.\n12. **Moisten the dollar bill.** Spray the dollar bill with water. Use a water bottle to mist evenly. Unlike when ironing a dollar bill, you want the bill to be noticeably moist or humid. However, it is not advised to completely soak the bill in water through submersion.\n13. **Press the bill between two heavy, flat objects.** Ideal objects to use for pressing include heavy books such as dictionaries or phone directories. These objects press the bill flat and hold it in place while it dries.\n\nPlace an absorbent material between the heavy object and the bill to prevent water damage to the pressing object and to facilitate drying. Try cheesecloth, hemp or other common absorbent fabrics to help absorb moisture from the bill.\n\nIf you don’t particularly care about the book in question, the bill along with the absorbent material can be placed within the book itself. Lay the book flat to ensure the bill dries without bends or folds.\nThe dollar bill can also be “framed” between two panes of glass as it dries. Framing the bill will help ensure a tight, flat seal and can take less space than stacking a few books.\n14. **Check in on the dollar bill as it dries.** Allow to dry overnight, checking in occasionally to gauge dryness. Change the absorbent material as necessary to keep the drying process moving at a steady pace.\n\nThe bill shouldn’t take longer than a few days to dry. If it takes longer than a few days, change the absorbent material more frequently. You may have also moistened the bill more than necessary.\nStore the press in an area that is not also dark or damp to avoid encouraging the growth of mold.\n15. **Repeat the process if needed.** Once the bill is dry, it should lay flat without folds or creases. However, if the bill still curls, you may repeat the process, provided the bill is not too flimsy or weak to withstand another treatment.\n16. **Place the dollar bill into a water basin that is full of water.** It doesn't have to be super full, but must be able to fully coat the entire bill from one end to the other. The basin though, has to have a flat bottom for this fix to hold. It doesn't matter what side the bill is placed in the basin with, for the side facing you, however, for simplicity, start with the front side facing you first.\nBe careful of the temperature of the water.  Although the water should be warm, it should never be scalding hot, as this could cause the bill to loose color.\n17. **Dribble a little bit of kitchen soap into the area where the bill is in the basin.** About a teaspoon or two might be enough. Two teaspoons will make it stiffer yet, but even closer to brand new than just the one teaspoon.\n18. **Use a bristle brush to gently rub the bill with the soapy water.** Rub the bill from one end to the other. Don't apply too much pressure that the bill's ink begins to come off, otherwise it will have no legal tender on it. Apply enough pressure, like you were brushing your hair- steady pressure running up and down the bill.\nRub the bill in circles with the bristle brush. Never rub straight across otherwise the bill's ink will smear and that's  good!\n19. **Turn the bill over when you have rubbed the bill's front side with the brush, and lay the back side of the bill face down in the same basin.** Repeat the process with the bristles to the back side of the bill.\n20. **Remove the bill when both sides have been \"cleaned\".** The soap helps restore the crispness that the bill once had when it came from the factory.\n21. **Iron the bill out with an iron and ironing board.** Listen for the little \"ticks\"; these ticking sounds are the water droplets evaporating from the newly washed bill. Again, the side you begin with really doesn't matter. Don't ever spray any of the water from the iron onto the bill, unless the iron is sticking to the bill for some reason.\n22. **Iron the opposite side of the bill out.** \n23. **Finish up.** The bill should now look closer to new than it once was.",

         "How to Know if Your Friend No Longer Likes You",
         "Friendships can be powerful things, but sometimes people's opinions about one another change. Whether from new life experiences, the passage of time, or any variety of other factors, sometimes people just don't want to be friends anymore. Sometimes that isn't very clear, and there are a variety of signs you can look for that should tell you that someone does not want to be friends anymore. If there is something wrong, you may try to fix it, or it might be best to end the friendship.\n1. **See if your friend is acting negatively towards you.** If your friend is regularly insulting or belittling you, or starting arguments over all kinds of things, they are not being a good friend. If your friend is doing this, confront them, and ask them to stop. If your friend doesn't, that is not a good sign.\n\nTypes of insults can include teasing, sarcasm, and cynicism, comments that may sound like jokes, but are meant to hurt you. Some insults are more subtle, like backhanded compliments (complimenting you for negative things) or guilt-tripping (where your friend blames you for their distresses and problems). In many cases, your friend may try to pass these insults off as humor, and ridicule you for taking them personally.\nIt is possible that your friend doesn't know they are insulting you. If you are concerned, confront them. If your friend didn't know, they may apologize right away.\n2. **Look out for how often you are communicating.** If your friend doesn't like you, they probably aren't making much of an effort to stay in touch. This means not just talking, but emails, texting, or any other form of communication. If you and your friend aren't talking very much, it is hard to say that you are still really friends.\n\nThis reduced communication can refer to frequency or length. You may not talk as often as you used to. Or, if you do talk, your conversations are now very short, and you find that you don't have much to talk about.\nYou can also see this if you are the one making an effort at communication. Friendship takes effort. If you are the only one trying to stay in touch, then your friend is probably not interested.\n3. **Ask yourself how you learn about new things in your friend's life.** Along with not talking much, chances are your friend won't have been keeping you up to date with changes in their life. Friendship takes effort, and you shouldn't learn new things about your friend only through other people or social media.\n4. **See if your friend ignores you for time with others.** If you try to make plans, and your friend says they are too busy but is later out with other friends during that time, that would be a sign of rejection.\n\nPeople change, have new interests, and new friends. If your friend appears to be doing other things with new people, then those new people probably fit in better with their new interests.\nIf your friend is not spending more time with others, but becoming withdrawn towards everyone, that could be a sign of more serious issues, like depression. If this might be the case, gather others, and as a group encourage your friend to seek help.\n5. **Think about how it feels being around your friend.** If your friendship is turning sour, your meetings will be tense, and you may feel anxious or uncomfortable in each other's presence. There may be a larger concern that you are not dealing with, or maybe you two have grown apart.\n6. **Talk to your friend.** Ask them about the things you have been noticing that suggest they don't like you. Be open and honest about your concerns. It may not solve all of them right away but may help you if your friend doesn't like you, or is angry about something in particular.\n\nBe prepared to be conciliatory, especially if you think your friend is angry at something you may have done. Showing you are open to compromise and reconciliation encourages your friend to do the same.\n\nWhen discussing your concerns, it is better to use \"I\" Statements. Don't start your complaints with \"You,\" (as in \"You are...\") which makes your opinion seem like a fact. Instead, lead with how you feel when your friend does something negative towards you (\"I feel...\"). After that, name your friend's behavior and why it makes you feel that way. This makes your statement less accusatory.\nIf you think you were in the wrong, but are not sure why it might be good to give an open-ended question. You want to allow them to talk, not give a simple answer to a direct question. Ask what is wrong, or what you did wrong.\nBe sure to give your friend some space after apologizing or asking for a response. This can be a lot to process, and you shouldn't expect an answer right away.\nIn some cases, it can help to take a self-inventory. Don't be afraid to ask your friend for their radical honesty in how you can be a better friend.\n7. **Ask yourself if things have changed in your lives.** Life leads people in different directions, and those directions may not include you or your old friends. Your friend may have new interests, and new friends that share those interests more than you do.\n8. **Don't get defensive.** Learning a friend doesn't like you can create some negative emotions. While you don't want to suppress them too much, it is best to use them as an opportunity to think more about yourself. Try to figure out what you are feeling (anger, fear, humiliation), to figure out what you can do next.\nAsk yourself what you think your friend meant. People don't always know the impact of their words and actions. Bringing it to their attention can get an apology. Or, perhaps they did mean it as a personal insult, in which case you will want to think about how much you want to keep this friendship.\n9. **Evaluate** You may have been (or became) a toxic friendship. These can be bad for your physical and mental wellbeing, and you should not be afraid to end it. Is this person a true friend? If you have been growing apart, especially for some time, then your friendship has probably been ready to end.\n\nSigns of a toxic friendship include: asking for advice, then belittling or ignoring it; dumping their issues on you without offering support for your problems; regularly picking fights or competing with you, and never being happy with your success.\nIn a true friendship, you and your friend will be supportive of one another, stay in regular contact, and be able to discuss disagreements respectfully and with some amicable resolution. True friendships take effort, and both of you need to be willing to put in the effort.\n10. **Accept it.** It does you no good to force someone to stay friends with you. That will likely only make things worse. It does not mean you failed, just that things have changed.",

         "How to Relax when Driving",
         "Whether you are a new driver getting used to the road, or an experienced driver just dealing with the normal challenges of commuting, driving can be a daunting task sometimes. You may feel frustration or anxiety crop up. But if you calm yourself in the moment, prepare for a relaxing drive, and handle your specific driving concerns you can relax when you are driving.\n1. **Practice deep breathing techniques.This is one way that you can instantly relax when you are driving.** Deep breathing slows your heart rate, lowers your blood pressure, and calms you overall.\n\nTake a slow, deep breath in through your mouth. Try to feel it in your lower abdomen. Slowly release the breath through your nose.\nTake a few deep breaths whenever you feel road rage or anxiety and tension building when you are driving.\nTake as many breaths as you need to calm yourself and feel relaxed.\n2. **Release tension in your body.** You may find that your hands are clinched on the wheel, shoulders hunched, neck tight, and jaw tense. You can relax when driving if you do things that relieve the tension in your body.\n\nShrug your shoulders up and down to relax them. Roll them forward and then backwards a few times.\nRelax your jaw and forehead. Smiling, even briefly, can help you relax your facial muscles.\nTurn your head slightly back and forth and left and right to release tension in your neck.\nDo some hand and finger stretches when you are stopped at a red light.\n3. **Use mindfulness strategies.** Being mindful means focusing your attention in the here and now, on driving and only driving. Focusing your mind completely on driving doesn’t give your mind much room to think about anything upsetting and can help you relax when you are driving.\n\nTake notice of all your senses as you drive. What do you hear, see, or smell? What does the car feel like?\nPay attention to how your body feels. You may say to yourself, “My shoulders feel tense and my stomach is queasy.”\nTake notice of your thoughts and emotions. For example, you might think, “I feel worried and nervous. I keep thinking about getting on the highway.”\nAllow yourself to experience your feelings without trying to stop them from happening.\nNotice as the feelings slowly go away and how you feel as they do.\n4. **Change your self-talk.** It is easy to start saying things to yourself that increase your feelings of tension, stress, anger, and anxiety. You can relax when you are driving if you make an effort to think relaxing thoughts and talk to yourself in a calm way.\n\nFor example , when someone is driving unsafely, you may want to say to yourself, “They cut me off! This is so frustrating! Driving makes me tense!”\nInstead, think, “He’s not driving safe. I’m glad I don’t have to stay around him. I’ll move to this lane. He’s not interrupting my relaxing drive.”\nOr, you may think to yourself, “I’m not good at driving in this traffic. Something bad is going to happen.”\nInstead, try saying to yourself, “This is a chance for me to practice driving in traffic. I’ll do just fine.”\n5. **Give yourself plenty of time.** Rushing to get somewhere can make you nervous and anxious. Instead, you can relax when driving if you make sure that you leave in enough time to arrive at your destination without rushing.\nAllow time for accidents, traffic, detours, and other unexpected events that might make you late.\n6. **Set up your car.** Preparing your car for your drive before you get behind the wheel can help you relax when driving. Before you get in, make sure that you have adjusted your controls and set the car up for your drive.\n\nPosition your seat in a comfortable position. You should be able to sit in the driver’s seat comfortably and still easily reach the pedals and steering wheel.\nAdjust your rearview and side mirrors so that you can see everything around you and don’t have to worry about adjusting them while you are driving.\nIf you are using GPS, go ahead and set your location and put the device somewhere that you can easily see it while driving.\nAdjust any other controls or settings, like temperature, beforehand so that you can focus on driving once you get started.\n7. **Turn on relaxing music.** Some research suggests that listening to classical, pop, or other downbeat music while you are driving can calm you down. So turn off the rock and rap and put on some pop or R&B to relax when you are driving.\n\nListening to more fast tempo music like rock can cause you to drive faster and get upset easier.\nTry to set your radio station or music before you start driving so that you aren’t distracted while you are driving.\n8. **Put your electronic devices away.** The distractions of alarms, alerts, and notifications can distract you and cause you to become tense while you are driving. To be safe and to relax when you are driving, put your electronic on silent or at least out of reach.\n\nYou can lose focus on driving as you try to see who is contacting you or become anxious as the beeps and tones continue to go off.\nSome phones and phone services have a ‘driving mode’ that can be used while you are driving to reduce your distractions.\nIf you need to, put your phone somewhere that you can’t reach it so you won’t be tempted to check it.\n9. **Talk to your passengers.** Having a conversation about ways to help you stay calm when you are driving can eliminate some of the stress passengers can add to driving. Let your passengers know that you want to be relaxed while you are driving and tell them what they can do to help.\n\nAsk your passengers to wear their seatbelt, try to be still, and talk calmly to you.\nFor example, you could say, “While I’m driving please don’t yell at me or try to get things out of the backseat. It makes me nervous.”\nTalk to children about how they should behave when they are passengers in a car.\nYou might say, “Kids, you should sit back, stay in your seatbelt, talk quietly, and no horseplay. This will keep you safe and me relaxed.”\n10. **Be confident when driving in new situations.** You may find yourself in a situation where you have to drive in conditions you aren’t used to. For example, you may have to take the highway when you are used to driving on residential streets. You can relax when driving in new situations if you remain confident in your driving ability.\n\nRemember that you know the basic rules of driving and that they are generally the same, regardless of the situation.\nYou might say to yourself, “This is a new situation, but I’m a safe driver and can handle this.”\nFor example, if you are driving in a construction zone for the first time, you might remind yourself, “I can do this. I’m confident in my driving ability.”\n11. **Use caution in inclement weather.** At some time or another you will likely have to drive when it is raining, snowing, or very windy. You can relax when you are driving in bad weather, however, if you stay alert and drive with caution.\n\nIf the weather is very bad, for example, there are high winds and hail, try to avoid driving at all.\nMake sure your headlights, brake lights, and windshield wipers are working before you leave.\nReduce your speed so that you can have time to react to anything that comes up when you are driving.\nPay attention and look for road hazards like fallen tree branches or flooding roadways.\n12. **Be alert when driving at night.** You can relax when you are driving at night if make sure that you are focused and paying attention to what is going on around you.\n\nLook out for motorists and pedestrians that may be hard to see at night. Use your mirrors often and look around ahead of you.\nMake sure your headlights are on and that your brake lights work before you start driving.\nDon’t drive when you are tired or sleepy.\n13. **Accept it when you are running late.** There will be times when, no matter how hard you try, you end up running late. Instead of getting nervous and trying to rush to get there, notify the appropriate person you will be late and accept it. This will help you relax when driving much more than trying to beat red lights to save a few seconds on your driving time.\n\nFor instance, if an accident on the interstate is making you late for work, instead of getting frustrated, call your supervisor and let her know.\nYou might say, “I wanted to let you know that I am on the way, I’m just running a few minutes late because of an accident.”\n14. **Stop other people in the car from distracting you.** When the kids are making a ruckus in the back seat or your mom is being a backseat driver, it can be very distracting and upsetting. You can relax when you are driving if you ask them not to distract you before you begin driving. If you are already driving, calmly, but firmly tell them to stop.\n\nFor instance, you might say, “Kids, when I start driving you have to sit back and talk quietly. This will keep me calm and all of us safe.”\nFor example, you can say, “Mom, I appreciate your concern, but you telling me how to drive is making me nervous. Please stop.”\nIf you need to, pull over until the distraction stops. This will keep you calm and safe.\n15. **Stay calm around rude drivers.** Although other drivers may do things that upset, frustrate, or even scare you like cutting you off, following too close, swerving, or even showing road rage, stay calm. Allowing rude drivers to upset you will prevent you from relaxing while driving.\n\nAvoid making rude gestures or even eye contact with other motorists. This could escalate the situation unnecessarily.\nWhen possible, change your rate of speed slightly so you can get away from the immediate area of the other driver.\nIf you feel threatened, roll up your windows and lock your doors. Call 911 if you think the situation may get violent.",

         "How to Look After a Pet Woodlouse",
         "Whether you know them as woodlice, roly-polies, potato bugs, slaters, pillbugs, carpenters, tiggy-hogs, parson-pigs, or doodlebugs, these tiny creatures are easy to care for. To make a comfortable habitat for them, put some soil, leaves, and twigs into a container. Then place your woodlice in the habitat and add a bit of fresh produce for them to nibble on. Keep the habitat moist and observe the woodlice for a few days before releasing them back into the wild.\n1. **Choose a sturdy container to hold the woodlice.** Look for a clean jar or empty shoebox to house your woodlice. To keep just a few woodlice, use a small jar. For lots of woodlice, consider purchasing a container, such as a plastic terrarium or glass aquarium from your local pet store.\nKeep in mind that if you pick a shoebox or small cardboard box, you won't be able to keep the woodlice for more than a day. This is because the moist material and environment will make the container break down quickly.\n2. **Put 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil in the container and add the woodlice.** Spread the soil in the container so the bottom is completely covered. Press down a little so the soil is firm enough to support the woodlice and their digging. Add as many woodlice to the container as you like.\nIf you're digging into the soil with a sharp shovel, use caution so you don't accidentally injure woodlice that may be in the ground.\n3. **Add leaves, sticks, and bark to give the woodlice something to explore.** Scatter about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of leaves across the soil in the container. It's fine to place these over the woodlice since they prefer to be under leaves and soil. You can also add small sticks or twigs and scraps of bark. Your woodlice will eat the leaves and climb around the sticks.\nLeave rocks out of the container since they can tumble and crush the woodlice, especially if the container is moved.\n4. **Cover the container and poke air holes across the top.** If the container has a lid, close it and ensure that air vents are open. To make your own air vents in a shoe box, put the lid on the box and carefully poke holes in the top. If you're using a jar, cover the jar with waxed paper, plastic wrap, or foil. Then use a sharp skewer to poke holes across the top.\n\nUse caution or ask for help when poking holes in the lid.\nEnsure that the holes aren't big enough that the woodlice can escape.\n5. **Place the woodlice container in a secure spot in your house.** Put it out of direct sunlight so the woodlice don't overheat. Since woodlice prefer a cool environment, you don't need to use any special heat lamps, just keep the container inside your house.\nIf you have other pets or small children, put the woodlice container somewhere out of their reach.\n6. **Spray the habitat to keep it moist.** Woodlice stay hydrated by absorbing humid air and eating food. To keep the soil and atmosphere in the habitat moist, fill a spray bottle with water. Then spritz the leaves and soil of the habitat until they're moist. Feel the soil every day and spray it whenever it feels dry to the touch.\n7. **Give the woodlice fresh produce.** Although the woodlice can eat the leaves that you put in their habitat, they'll need produce to nibble on. Put slices of raw potatoes, carrots, apples, or pears onto the leaves and leave them for the woodlice to eat.\nReplace the produce every few days so the food doesn't begin to mold.\n8. **Clean the container if you keep the woodlice for more than 1 week.** If you're planning on keeping the woodlice for over a week, you'll need to clean out the habitat. Remove leaves that are molding and replace some of the soil with fresh soil.\n\nIf you're using a terrarium or aquarium, wipe down the glass if there's dirt or smudges on it.\nWhile it's safe to keep them for longer, you should release them into their natural habitat so they can mate.\n9. **Hold the woodlice gently when you want to handle them.** If you'd like to take a woodlouse out of its container to observe, carefully pick it up with your thumb and forefinger. Leave it in the palm of your hand until it unrolls. You can also set it down on a flat surface so you can count how many legs it has and watch how it moves.\nUse light pressure when you pick up the woodlice since it's easy to accidentally crush them with too much pressure.",

         "How to Prevent Carpet Beetles",
         "Carpet beetles are household pests that hide out in closets, air vents, and similar places. When left alone, they can multiply rapidly and cause excessive damage to things like carpet and clothing. Prevention is key to containing the problem before it gets out of hand.\n1. **Vacuum and steam clean carpets regularly.** Go over carpets and rugs thoroughly at least once a week with a vacuum cleaner. Doing this and annually cleaning with steam will prevent larvae from being able to live, grow and eat because it removes their food sources: lint, hair, and dead insects. You can either hire a professional to clean your carpets or you can steam them yourself.\n2. **Keep storage areas clean.** Vacuum floors, walls, and shelves of storage spaces at least two or three times a month to remove dust, spider webs, and any inconspicuous eggs or larvae that are hiding in corners.\n3. **Wash potentially infested clothes and other fabrics with hot, soapy water.** Any trace of adult carpet beetles, larvae, and eggs can be removed with a good washing. Carpet beetles won’t have time to sustain life on your clothing if you stay on top of washing them.\n\nWash and air out clothes immediately after they’re removed from storage. Don’t wait to do this until after you wear the clothes or hang them in your closet because this will allow any present beetles to find a new area to thrive in.\n\nEach month, make sure that any clothes kept in your closet or dresser that you haven’t worn and washed get a good warm wash and air dry too.\n4. **Clean out your trash cans.** Every time you take out your trash, wipe the inside of your trash can lid with a disinfectant wipe. Once or twice a year, spray down your trash cans inside and out with a mixture of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of bleach and 24 fluid ounces (709.8 ml) of water, rinse the cans thoroughly with a hose, and wipe them dry with a hand towel or paper towel.\n5. **Remove dead bugs from crevices.** Constantly be on the lookout for dead insects in the cracks of the walls and flooring of your home. Try removing dead bugs by vacuuming over them or picking them up with a paper towel. Cracks are one of the more subtle living spaces that carpet beetles can thrive within.\n6. **Choose synthetic materials over organic fabrics when possible.** Get products made of synthetic fibers instead of natural ones as often as you can. Carpet beetles don’t feed on synthetic fabric. Keep this in mind when purchasing furniture, rugs, and carpets. \nCarpet beetles like wool in particular. Wool contains keratin, which carpet beetles eat.\n7. **Donate old clothes instead of keeping them stored for months or years at a time.** The longer you keep fabrics folded in a compact manner in a dark, hidden place, the more likely it is that carpet beetles will get to them. This is the kind of environment that they prefer. Avoid keeping garments, bedding, wool rugs, or upholstered furniture in storage. Instead, if you haven’t used the items in the past six months or so, consider dropping them off for donation.\n8. **Store fabrics in tightly sealed plastic.** Especially if your closet frequently goes untouched and sees little sunlight, opt to put less used clothing into tightly sealed plastic bags. Use of plastic bags will reduce your chances of attracting any carpet beetles by creating a barrier.\n9. **Store fabric in a cedar-lined chest or closet.** Initially, the oils in cedar help to deter carpet beetles. Unfortunately, this can only serve as a preventative tool for a few years because the wood will dry out and no longer be as powerful. This is a good short-term action to take, and is most effective when the chest or closet has the ability to be sealed well.\n\nYou can also hang your clothes on cedar hangers to discourage carpet beetles.\nOther cedar products such as cedar oils, chips, and repellent balls can also be beneficial but are usually only effective with killing or deterring larvae.\n10. **Seal holes and cracks in storage containers.** Make sure that whatever you’re using to store your clothing has no openings whatsoever, whether you’re using plastic bags, garment bags, trunks, or boxes. Cover the cracks, tears, and holes with a durable tape, such as duct tape.\n11. **Secure window screens and air vents.** Keep all small entrances to your home as sealed and secured as possible. Repair or replace any damaged or torn screens that you currently have, and make sure that your screens are made of a fine mesh. Use caulk along the outside edges of air vents to seal them securely. These security measures will prevent beetles from flying in from outside.\n12. **Hang sticky fly paper near windows and other potential entrances.** Use fly paper near doorways and windowsills to catch any carpet beetles that attempt to enter your home. The beetles will stick to the paper and will die as a result of being unable to escape.\n13. **Inspect dark, secluded areas of your home for molted skins.** If you’re suspicious or just want to be proactive, search through rarely lit, less trafficked areas of your home for fecal matter and most importantly, molted larvae skins. Larvae are commonly the ones who cause the most damage, and molted skins, identifiable by their translucent golden color and bug-like shape, are a strong sign that they’re present.\n14. **Dispose of heavily infested items.** If you can part ways with the items that were just infested, it’s probably best to do so. With keeping an item that was previously highly infested, you run the risk of reintroducing any remaining carpet beetles to your carpet and clothes.\n15. **Spray or dust your carpet and furniture with an insecticide.** There are many different types of carpet treatment products that you can buy. Make sure that whatever spray or dust you’re applying is for killing carpet beetles specifically, and check the label of chemical insecticides to make sure that the product contains chlorpyrifos, bendiocarb, and allethrin in order to ensure eradication success.\n\nChemical insecticides may be harmful to other animals, so if you have any pets make sure to secure them in a location away from where the insecticide is sprayed or dusted.\nSpread boric acid all over your carpet and upholstered furniture, and make sure to vacuum it up within two hours of laying it down. While it is lethal for beetles, boric acid isn’t powerful enough to harm humans.\n\nDehydrate carpet beetles with diatomaceous earth. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth on pet beds and in the back of cabinets and closets. It’s safe for pets and humans, but you’ll need to wear a respirator or mask while applying to keep yourself from inhaling the particles.\n\nMany common household pesticides that kill ants and roaches will also kill carpet beetles, or simply limit their food supply. Spray the product in corners of closets, on window ledges, and in any crevices that could potentially house carpet beetles.\n16. **Store clothes and fabrics with resin strips or moth repellent.** Because resin strips contain an active ingredient called dichlorvos, they are effective in protecting your fabrics for an extended period of time. Vapors of moth repellent are lethal for fabric pests if they are maintained at high concentrations for an extended period of time. Keep your resin strips or moth repellent in a tightly sealed container along with your clothing for two to three weeks for the best results.",

         "How to Treat and Prevent Bloat in Cattle",
         "Bloat in cattle is a serious problem—and a very old one—that is often associated with consumption of high quality feeds that are easily digestible and rapidly fermented in the rumen. (Bloat is not just a problem exclusive to cattle, it also occurs in other ruminants like sheep and goats).\nThere are methods to diagnose and treat bloat, some which you can do yourself, but others are best to have a bovine veterinarian to come out to help you with, especially when you have to deal with things like trocars and frick tubes. Please call a veterinarian immediately when you have an emergency.\n\nMethods to prevent bloat involve quite a bit of management, regardless if this is feedlot or pasture bloat. These will be talked about quite a bit below.\n1. **Learn about Frothy Bloat.** Also known as \"primary ruminal tympany,\" frothy bloat is primarily caused by pasture legumes (predominantly alfalfa and clovers), and other high quality forages such as young green cereal crops, canola/rapeseed, kale, turnips, and legume vegetable crops (peas, beans, chickpeas, lentils, etc.)\n\nRapid degradation of highly digestible plant matter will cause a sudden release of cell contents that are available for microbes to digest. This sudden increase in nutrient availability causes microbial blooms, which in turn doubly increase rate of digestion.\nSoluble proteins and carbohydrates make up a large part of the cell contents, as do small particles which are actually parts of the plant cell walls these microbes attach themselves to. Any excess carbohydrates that microbes do not break down are stored as \"slime\" over their cellular bodies. This slime is highly viscous and very stable.\n\nMicrobes also release a lot of gas with fermentation and digestion of these plant tissues. But with the additional build up of slime, gas is trapped in these highly stable, slimy bubbles. Rumen pressure increases the more slime and gas is produced.\nJust as with free-gas bloat below, the more pressure that builds up in the rumen, the more pressure is put on the lungs. If not treated promptly, the animal eventually dies of suffocation from not being able breathe.\n\nFrothy bloat is also seen in feedlot cattle that have been on a high-concentrate ration for 1 to 2 months. The cause is uncertain but it's thought that certain rumen microbes may create the stable slime, or conditions where increasing feed intake of grain is done and/or grain is fed as too fine a particulate matter; this makes conditions where there's too much concentrate and not enough roughage in the diet.\n2. **Learn about Free-Gas Bloat.** This type of bloat is commonly associated with a blockage or something (like swollen lymph nodes) restricting the esophagus preventing the animal from normally burping up gases from normal process of rumination. Veterinarians call it \"secondary ruminal tympany.\"\n\nIt is also associated as a secondary issue related to an acute or clinical case of grain overload or acidosis when a drop in rumen pH causes an inflammation of the rumen and esophagus that interferes with normal eructation (burping).\nWhen cattle have an allergic reaction to a particular drug or substance, this can also cause secondary ruminal tympany if an animal experiencesanaphylaxis as a result.\nMilk fever can also create a case of free-gas bloat.\nIf animals are in a position where they cannot get up; like if they are laying out on their sides or have been put onto their backs for an extended time where they cannot roll over and get up (as in handling facilities, irrigation ditches, or crowded transportation vehicles), they can actually die of bloat because the rumen puts significant pressure on their lungs.\n3. **Watch for distended abdomens.** The first and most important sign you need to be looking for in bloated cattle is an unusual distention of the upper left side (left flank) of the animal. The whole rumen may be enlarged resulting in a large distention of the left side. \nThe left side is where the rumen is situated, and where you are most likely to see how much an animal is bloating.\n4. **Look for signs of discomfort.** Bloated cattle will often kick at their bellies with their hind legs, act restless (laying down and getting up frequently), defecate often, and even roll over as an attempt to relieve the discomfort.\n5. **Look for difficulty breathing.** Animals will try to breathe through their mouths because it becomes more difficult to breathe with the distended rumen pressing onto the lungs and diaphragm. These animals will also have excess salivation, their tongue protruding like they are panting, and head extended to get the most air into their lungs as possible.\n6. **Watch for dead animals.** Death can occur quickly once an animal begins bloating, but it usually doesn't occur until 2 or 4 hours after first onset.\n\nDeath occurs because of the distended rumen pushing up against the diaphragm of the animal preventing inhalation. Bloat that becomes severe enough will cause an animal to collapse and die quickly, almost without struggle.\nHave a vet to come out to do a necropsy on your dead cattle to verify if they died of bloat. Regardless the cause of death, a bovine's rumen will swell after death because of the continued fermentation occurring well after the animal has died, resulting in a misdiagnosis without getting the vet to perform a post-mortem exam.\n\nDead animals are more likely to occur with pastured beef cattle than dairy cattle because dairy cattle are checked more often.\n7. **Treat bloated animals (those still alive) immediately.** The next section talks about how you can relieve bloat in an affected animal as quickly and efficiently as possible.\nTreatment does depend on how severe the animals are bloated. Mild cases just need animals to move around. But severe cases will require a visit from a veterinarian as soon as possible.\n8. **Remove all animals from the bloat-causing source immediately.** All animals, not just the ones that are bloating, need to be removed so that bloating does not progress any further that it already is.\nMove them onto a non-legume pasture or a sacrifice lot area for the time being.\n9. **Assess the animals to see how severe bloat is.** Bloat cases range from mild to severe.\n\nMild cases show a distention of the left flank but the animal does not appear to be in distress.\nModerate cases show a more obvious distention of the rumen, particularly on the left side. Animals appear uncomfortable but are not yet showing signs of laboured breathing.\nSevere cases show a gross distention of the abdomen, a lot of discomfort, and a protruding tongue with obvious signs of laboured breathing.\nIf you can get the animal to where you can try tenting the skin, then note that mild and moderate bloat cases will allow you to grasp the skin and tent it. You won't be able to do so with a severe bloat case.\n10. **Call your local bovine veterinarian immediately.** Tell them it's an emergency and that you need them to come out now.\nOr, if you can load up the affected animal[s] in a trailer to ship them to a local veterinary clinic, then do so as quickly as possible, even if it means having to load them up right in the pasture.\nIf you have chosen and have the means to do the latter alternative, then the following steps are not necessary to follow. But, if you can't ship them to the veterinary clinic, the the next steps will be important to follow to save your animals.\n11. **Restrain the animal that needs treatment.** There will be no possibility of being able to treat a bloated animal out in the field without restraining it in a working alley or holding chute so that it can't move back or forward or try to turn around. A squeeze chute is ideal, except in this instance squeezing the sides may help only if you can put the sides in so much that they're not going to put too much pressure on the animal's already painfully-distended sides.\nIt's better if the animal is standing when things like tubing, putting in a trocar, or in worst-case scenarios, doing a rumenotomy, is needed to save these animals.\n12. **Attend to the severely bloated animals first and foremost.** These animals have less time to live and deserve priority treatment to survive. Never hesitate to attend to these animals first.\nFirst thing you need to do is to try to relieve the pressure with a stomach tube. The animal may have free-gas bloat that can be easily relieved with a stomach tube. Other more invasive methods, which are more effective but traumatic, should be used only if the stomach tubing doesn't work.\n13. **Use a stomach tube.** The following steps are just like giving cattle oral medications, and should be followed in a very similar manner. Stomach tubing should also be seriously considered as a means to relieve gas pressure in the rumen on a severely-bloated case and should be first priority, because it is the least traumatic method available to save a bloated animal. It is a method most used and most recommended by the majority of cattle producers.\n\n\n Go in by nudging into the corners of the mouth to get the animal to open its mouth. Don't really force the tube in, but only go in so much until the animal starts swallowing the tube. Keep going until there's only a little over 2 inches (~6 cm) of tube outside the mouth. Don't let go of the tube!The Frick speculum or metal tube (a stiff 1-1/2-inch to 1-1/4 inch PVC pipe will also work) which is ground off at the ends to prevent damage to the mouth and esophageal tissues is a 3-foot long hollow tube. It is needed to prevent the animal from chewing on and damaging the stomach tube.\n\n\n The stomach tube should be passed through the Frick speculum into the esophagus, where it's swallowed by the animal and goes into the rumen. You can tell you've enter the rumen by the smell coming from the tube. You will not need to put the tube in all the way, rather so that about 1 m (3 feet) is still sticking out.\nThe stomach tube must be 6 feet (2 m) long and has an inside diameter of 1.5 to 2 cm (5/8 to 3/4 inches). If you don't have a stomach tube like that offered through veterinary supply, a 3/4 to 1-inch (2 to 2.5 cm) diameter garden hose with the metal coupling removed will work, or a 5/8 to 3/4 inch (1.5 to 2 cm) heater-hose from an auto-parts store; both with their ends ground down so that the edges are smooth.\n\n\n Once the hose enters the bloated rumen the hose will become blocked with froth. You may also need to blow through the tube to free the froth from the other end.\nWith frothy bloat and tubing it may be next to impossible to reduce the pressure. It's a different story if your animal has \"free-gas bloat.\" With free-gas bloat, once the tube enters the rumen the gas is quickly released in less than a minute.\n\n\n Attach the free end of the hose to the drenching gun and pump the mineral oil-water mix (or straight mineral oil; ideal dose is 300 to 500 mL (10 to 12  oz. per dose)) into the rumen.\n\n\n Release the animal when done, but keep it in an area where you can keep an eye on it for the next few hours. You may need to repeat after a few hours.\n14. **Use a trocar and cannula for situations where stomach tubing is not enough.** In these situations, though the animal is showing signs of laboured breathing and quite distended, he doesn't appear close to death quite yet. Also, a trocar is necessary when a stomach tube is not enough to expel the gas in the rumen (next steps below).\n\n\n The incision should only be 1 centimetre (0.39 in) long so that the trocar and cannula can be placed into the rumen. The hole also needs to be small enough so that the cannula will stay in.\n\n Grasp the top of the handle of the trocar and with one move inward, punch through the abdominal muscles into the rumen.This will take a concerted effort (done right and only once) because the abdominal muscles are not soft like cookie dough. It will hurt the animal, but remember this is done not for the purpose of hurting the animal, but rather to save its life.\n\n\n Doing so allows the froth and gases to escape from the rumen. Some cannulae offered are plastic with ridges around the top so that once the rumen is punctured, the cannula is screwed into the animal so that it cannot come out. This is an advantage over the\n\n The froth tends to be quite thick and heavy (or viscous) and difficult to break up, which is the reason why it's been hard for the gases to escape from the cow normally, without any human intervention. Stirring the froth will release some more gas and help break up the bubbles.\n\n Use a drenching gun to do so, adding around 2 US gallons (7.57 L) directly into the rumen. Adding an anti-foaming agent will help break up the bubbles a lot quicker.\n\n Check the animal and the cannula regularly for any blockage that can occur when the froth solidifies via drying when exposed to air. Check with the vet as well, as you may need to inject an antibiotic like penicillin to ward off infection. Infection is inevitable with having a cannula in the animal for several days.\n\nThe trocar and cannula method may be less traumatic than a rumenotomy, but it's completely understandable if you are reluctant to do this method, even if you fully understand it means saving your bovine and not deliberately hurting it. Have a vet to come out and do this method for you. They will certainly show you what needs to be done and how to properly do it should you need to perform this procedure yourself in the future.\n15. **Perform an emergency rumenotomy if a trocar and cannula is not available, and if a stomach tube is not sufficient to relieve a very severe bloat case.** When the vet is not close by and the animal is so severely bloated that you think you might lose him soon, then you will need to grab a very sharp knife and perform a rumenotomy to relieve the pressure and save the animals life.\n\nThe procedure you will have to do in an emergency situation is not going to be painless for the animal, but when it comes down to needing to save his life versus causing him more pain than he is already in with a nasty, bloated stomach ache that is progressively suffocating him to death, ethics should tell you that saving his life should be of far greater priority over being scared of causing an animal pain.\n\n It's a matter of life or death!!\n\n\n This region is also known as the hollowed triangle past the ribs and in front of the hip that can be easily found in a non-bloated bovine.\n\n\n This will give the animal quite the relief, and allow him to breathe freely again.\n\nThis method is quite traumatic for the animal, and even the person having to do the procedure. If in doubt, contact your local bovine veterinarian and have them walk you through the procedure, or hope the animal will live long enough for the vet to come out to do it for you.\n16. **Release the animal when you are finished.** Move on to the next animal with a bloat problem. But if you only have one, that's great. Just keep an eye on this animal for the next few days to see if bloat is recurring or if anything else needs to be done.\nKeep your vet on speed-dial just in case anything goes wrong or if you have any questions that need answering right away.\n17. **Never put hungry animals onto fresh legume pasture.** Before you introduce animals to an alfalfa pasture, no matter the quality, make sure they are filled up on hay first (alfalfa-grass hay preferably; or have free-choice access to hay) before introducing them onto an alfalfa stand.\nWhen moving to a new pasture, move the animals when they don't appear interested in what's on the other side of the fence.\n18. **Once they're on legume pasture, keep them on there.** You need to make sure your animals have a uniform and regular intake of legume forages both day and night. Do not use intermittent grazing (removing them at night and putting them back on in the morning or even mid-day) because this will encourage sudden bloat-outbreaks.\n\nResearchers studying bloat actually use intermittent grazing to encourage bloat outbreaks for their studies. Intermittent grazing causes sudden outbreaks because the animals are taken off high-quality forage for several hours and then receive a sudden influx of high-nutrients when they go back on. This sudden introduction to high nutrient forages causes bloat.\nIt is impossible to control conditions where grazing will be interrupted by adverse weather (thunderstorms, hail, etc.), biting insects, or terrible heat waves that forces animals into the shade during the day. Animals will alter their normal grazing habits so that grazing is more shorter and intense, creating bloat issues.\nIn these instances, animals will need to be monitored and possibly even fed hay along with their grazing so bloat issues are reduced.\n19. **Use management-intensive grazing to reduce length of grazing period cattle are on a paddock or pasture.** If livestock where put onto a legume pasture where they could select-graze what plants they wanted to eat, bloat problems could arise.\n\nSituations where animals have not yet acquired a taste for alfalfa and are continuously grazed will select first mostly grasses and other plants and try to avoid most alfalfa. When these plants have been depleted, they will then target the alfalfa, and as a result will bloat. This can happen a few days to a week or so after being introduced onto a legume-mix pasture.\nWith rotational or management-intensive grazing, livestock are managed so that they will graze a paddock every one to 3 days. This discourages selective grazing by the animals, and encourages leaving behind plant residue, especially when a \"take-half-leave-half\" system is used.\nIt's important to move cattle to a fresh paddock when they are not hungry, or do not appear interested in moving to a new forage stand. Doing so encourages plant residue to be left behind after each move. You can never really have too much residue left behind after grazing, because it's better to have \"lots\" behind that could be grazed more, than to move them when there's almost nothing left, and as a result they're quite hungry for the next paddock.\n20. **Move animals to a new pasture or paddock in late afternoon, never in the morning.** Cattle tend to eat more in the morning than the afternoon, and heavy dew in the morning also increases rate of digestibility, which increases the likelihood for bloat.\n21. **Defer grazing until legume plants are fully grown or in full-bloom.** Pre-bloom or vegetative alfalfa and clover are a significantly higher risk for bloat than more mature plants. If you take a piece of stem and leaf in your hand of immature alfalfa and roll them into a ball, then squeeze, you will find that a lot of juice and froth will come out. This is a sign that it is very highly digestible. Plants that are in full bloom are higher in fibre and less digestible, thus lower risk for bloat.\n22. **Graze pastures that have been swathed and wilted down for 24 to 48 hours This wilting reduces moisture content of the swathed plants (via evaporation and transpiration).** Lower moisture reduces bloat incidence.\n23. **Use an anti-foaming agent when grazing cattle on high-legume pastures.** Check with your local veterinarian or livestock-farm supply store for an anti-foaming agent that can be given to cattle. Bloat Guard is one product that may be readily available. The detergent \"poloxalene\", the active ingredient in Bloat Guard, has been found to be very effective at controlling bloat. (It's not guaranteed to prevent bloat when offered free-choice when mixed with grain because of variable intake levels and time period between visits.)\n\nAlfasure is another product offered via prescription from your vet that is effective at bloat-control.\nFree-choice trace mineral salt may also help reduce bloat incidences.\n24. **Establish bloat-safe legumes into an existing pasture or when seeding down a new pasture.** Bloat-safe legumes include cicer milkvetch, birdsfoot trefoil, sainfoin, and fenugreek. While these legumes are harder to establish than alfalfa or clover, once established they can be managed so that they help with reducing or eliminating bloat altogether in your animals.\n\nFor example, a stand that is at least 60% legume and 40% grass with the legume component made up of 25 to 30% sainfoin in an alfalfa-sainfoin legume mix will be enough to reduce bloat by as much as 98%. Sainfoin has condensed tannins that bind to proteins in the rumen and prevent their degradation by rumen microbes.\nA legume stand made up predominantly of non-bloating legumes will also work well.\n25. **Improve production practices so that you increase the amount of grass in with alfalfa or clover stands.** You may have a stand that is predominantly clover and alfalfa and want to increase the amount of grass in there. Options to do so is to apply nitrogen fertilizer, seed grass into the existing stand, or heavy-graze the legumes.\n\nNitrogen fertilizer will encourage grasses to outcompete the legumes, and cause the legume nodules to be \"lazy\" and fix less nitrogen as a result.\nSeed down grasses when stand has been grazed heavily or cut low, and harrow after to encourage seed-to-soil contact. Adding nitrogen to the stand will encourage existing grasses to also grow. Auto-toxicity from existing alfalfa plants will not affect the germinating grasses.\nHeavy grazing will negatively affect the alfalfa plants. Impact to the roots and not allowing plants to reseed themselves can reduce alfalfa stands in the pasture, but increase grass. Be careful about overgrazing, though.\n26. **Prevent feedlot frothy bloat by feeding more roughage and less fine grains.** Feedlot finisher rations should include at least 10 to 15% roughage. Grains should never be finely ground to where it is good for pig or chicken feed, instead they should be rolled or cracked.\n27. **Cull cattle in breeding herds if they are prone to bloating.** Current studies have shown that bloating is heritable, can can be reduced in a breeding herd by culling out those animals that have bloated, if natural occurrences haven't taken care of some of those animals for you (i.e., animals die of bloat).\nCulling is less possible if you have a herd were culling is not an option, such as if you are custom-grazing or -feeding cattle. Careful management needs to be implemented to reduce risk of bloat in cattle. See the bulleted tips above.",

         "How to Make an Insect Hotel",
         "If you're interested in bugs and insects, an insect hotel can be a fun DIY project. An insect hotel is a structure designed to help insects find shelter and build nests. You can use many different structures to make an insect hotel, depending on how big of a hotel you want. From there, fill in the hotel with suitable materials for insects. Choose a safe place outside to set up your hotel.\n1. **Select a location in your yard.** When looking for a location for your hotel, find an area in your yard close to other wildlife features. These are areas where it's likely bugs already linger. If you have a pond, this may be a good location. You may also want to set up your hotel near a bush, tree, or shrub.\n2. **Pick a spot that catches both sun and shade.** An insect hotel is meant to cater to a variety of insects. Invertebrates often prefer dark and damp environments, while bees and butterflies like sunshine. You want to place your hotel in an area that gets both sun and shade.\n\nAn area near a large tree or hedge can be particularly helpful when it comes to catching shade and sunlight.\nHive-like structures and nectar-producing plants cater to bees and butterflies, and should be placed on the sunny site.\nDry twigs, straw, and hay cater more to invertebrates, and should be placed in the shade.\n3. **Make sure your hotel is on a flat surface.** You do not want your hotel to fall over. This could injure and potentially kill insects that seek shelter. Therefore, make sure the surface where you set your hotel is level. If you find a surface is bumpy or uneven, pick another spot for your insect hotel.\n4. **Try an old birdhouse.** You may not want to make an incredibly big insect hotel. If you're just looking for something small to place in your backyard, go for an old birdhouse. An old wooden birdhouse can be easily repurposed as a bug hotel.\n\nYou can really use any old wooden box. It's better to reuse materials than to end up throwing them away.\nIf you're no longer using a small chest or toy box, you can use this as the structure of an insect hotel.\n5. **Use pallets and cinderblocks.** Some people want a very large insect hotel. This can be easily made by using old pallets and cinderblocks to create a tall structure. If you don't have old pallets lying around, you can make a trip to the hardware store. However, any long flat object, like old boards of wood, can be used instead.\n\nFirst, select where you want to place your structure. Then, place four cinderblocks on the ground in a rectangle shape and lie the pallets across them to form a floor-like structure.\nPlace four more cinderblocks on top of the pallets, then build another floor. You can add as many stories as you would like to your bug hotel,\n6. **Construct a box from cedar pieces.** You can also build your own structure for an insect hotel using cedar pieces. Much like an old birdhouse, cedar pieces will make for a fairly small hotel. You will need two cedar pieces of 5 1/2″(h) x 5 1/2″(w) for the top and bottom. The back panel will be 12″(h) x 5 1/2″(w). The right and left panel will be 12″(h) x 4 3/4″(w). You can get cedar cut at a local hardware store.\n\nUse a power drill to drill holes in the cedar box, and then use weather-resistant screws to piece the different parts together.\nScrew the right and left panel onto the top and bottom panel. This will give you a rectangular outline that you can easily place over the bottom panel.\nThen, drill the bottom panel in place.\n7. **Consider the type of bugs in your area.** Ideally, an insect hotel will be appealing to a wide variety of bugs. However, there may be a particular type of bug you want to attract. You may also know a certain type of bug is particularly prevalent in your backyard. In this case, you may want to prioritize certain materials when filling your insect hotel.\n\nIf you have bees in your yard, rolled-up bits of paper and leaves can provide hive-like holes for them. This may keep them from building hives in unwanted areas.\nDry materials, like straw, hay, and leaves, are great for invertebrates. Invertebrates include worms, crickets, cockroaches, millipedes, and mosquitos.\n\nIf you have a lot of butterflies and bees in your yard, you may want to put potted nectar-producing plants in your insect hotel.\n8. **Create holes.** Many different types of bugs like to have crevices to hide in. It's a good idea to have at least one section of your insect hotel full of holes.\n\nPut hollowed-out plants stems into a drain pipe. Then, place that drain pipe into a section of the insect hotel to make an excellent shelter for bees.\nYou can also pack one section of the hotel full of rows of rolled-up papers. Try to make holes of various diameters so they'll cater to many different insects.\n\nTry drilling smaller holes into a piece of wood, then set the wood into one corner of your hotel. Small holes may be better for smaller insects.\n9. **Gather materials outside.** You want to fill your insect hotel with as many items as possible. Once you've made a few sections dedicated to holes, find materials outside. Place these materials in other sections of the insect hotel, forming a busy habitat that caters to many different types of bugs. You should look for the following when building your insect hotel:\n\nDead wood\nDry leaves\nOld bark\nDry sticks and twigs\n10. **Add straw and hay.** In addition to gathering materials outside, you should purchase straw and hay for your house. Straw and hay create cracks and crevices. They also provides invertebrates the option of burrowing and hibernating in the soft material.",

         "How to Clean an Aquamarine Ring",
         "Aquamarine is a blue green stone that is the birthstone for the month of March. It is a hardy stone. Because of its light color, the stone can get dirty or cloudy when you wear the ring. Cleaning your aquamarine often can keep it beautiful and shining. To clean your aquamarine ring, wash it with warm soapy water and avoid doing anything that will damage the stone.\n1. **Fill a bowl with water.** The safest way to clean an aquamarine ring set in gold or any non-silver metal is to use soap and warm water. Take a small bowl and fill it with warm water. Add a drop of dish soap.\n2. **Soak the ring.** Place the ring in the warm soapy water. Leave it soaking for around five minutes. If it is really dirty or dingy, leave it soaking for longer.\n3. **Scrub the gem carefully with a soft toothbrush.** Remove the ring from the water. Use a toothbrush with soft bristles to clean the band and the stone. Gently move the bristles across the surfaces.\n\nBe careful around the prongs that hold the stone. The prongs are usually vulnerable and can bend or break if they are damaged.\nDo not use a toothbrush on the band if the setting is silver.\nIf your setting is made of yellow gold, white gold, stainless steel, platinum, or other metals, you can use the soft toothbrush to gently clean the band.\n4. **Rinse the ring.** After scrubbing, rinse the ring with warm water. Make sure to remove all the soap. Either let it air dry or gently dry it with a towel.\nMake sure to dry the ring completely if the band is made of silver.\n5. **Polish with a soft jeweler’s cloth if the band is made of silver.** If your aquamarine stone has a silver setting, you can’t clean the band with the toothbrush at the same time as the stone. Instead, use a soft cloth. You can soak it in water and clean the aquamarine with a toothbrush, but must clean the band a different way. After drying the ring completely, take a soft jeweler’s cloth and buff the stone and the band.\nIf your band is silver, you can skip the soaking step and just use the soft cloth to clean both the stone and band unless the stone is extremely dirty.\n6. **Refrain from using harsh chemicals.** Though aquamarine is a hard stone, it may be damaged by chemicals. Don’t use alcohol or ammonia to clean aquamarine. Though it might work on some of your other rings, those chemicals can damage the stone.\n7. **Avoid placing aquamarine under heat.** Unlike some gemstones, you should never place aquamarine rings into the microwave or in boiling water to clean. This can damage the stone. You should also never put them in an ultrasonic or steam cleaner.\n8. **Wrap your ring in a soft cloth when storing.** Aquamarine stones can get scratched and may fade in the sun. To protect your aquamarine ring from dirt or damage, wrap the ring in a soft cloth. You may also want to place it in a small box or bag for safe keeping.",

         "How to Stop Believing in Horoscopes",
         "As tempting as they may be to read for a bit of a lark, getting hooked on horoscopes as a guide for your daily life isn't being fair on yourself. Your destiny is largely determined by the choices you make and one of those choices can certainly be to stop believing in horoscopes and to start taking charge of your own self-analysis and daily routine. Once you've decided it's time to stop basing your week's plans around the horoscope or your love life around star sign compatibility, you're free to chart your own course and discover people for who they really are.\n1. **Look up the history of horoscopes.** Doing a bit of learning about how horoscopes developed and how they have been used throughout history will help you to see that they are just a pseudo-science.\n2. **Consider how the positions of stars have changed since horoscopes were first formed.** The signs aren't even in the same positions as they once were.\n3. **Consider how the planet positions change constantly.** Due to the fact that all the planets are constantly changing their positions, these cycles in fact never actually repeat themselves, making each person an absolute individual. A single horoscope can therefore never capture the breadth of personality and destiny of any single person.\n4. **Note that sun-sign astrology has some severe limitations when the science is applied to it.** For example: \n\nThe Sun is a star with a large mass. Extensive research undertaken on earthquakes and the positions of the planets has shown that they strongly affect the rate of earthquakes and that the Sun has no greater effect than any of the other planets.\n\nDepending on the Suns' relationship to the the other planets, the nature of the influences can in fact be the exact opposite of what is traditionally stated in sun-sign astrology.\nDue to the fact that the characteristics of the sun-sign can be the same as the traditional characteristics, the opposite, or somewhere in between, there can be no sound statistical method that would work just based on the traditional characteristics of the sign.\n5. **Realize that horoscopes are just for fun and do not mean anything.** You can help to convince yourself of this by trying the following:\n\nCheck your horoscope (hopefully for the last time).\nLook at what your horoscope says. Then look at a different sign's horoscope. Can they both be applied to you? Then try looking at all the different signs. See how general they are? At least a few can be applied to anyone, including yourself, which proves that they are not specialized in any way whatsoever.\n\nIf you find yourself thinking that you need to change to fit a horoscope, you have a clear answer that it's not accurate. It is also not the slightest bit unusual to find yourself thinking that some of the horoscope applies to you, while a lot of it doesn't. Seize that moment and realize it for what it is––your mind is telling you that the fit is wrong because no single horoscope can discern who you are. Unfortunately, many people choose to ignore the bits that don't fit and exaggerate the value of the parts that do, hence giving meaning to something that simply hasn't earned it.\n6. **Think about the personality traits revealed in the signs.** Do their personalities really match the personalities that the horoscope claims them to have? Do the people born in the same month as you act exactly like you? You will see that this is not the case - everyone has some stronger personality traits, but they don't necessarily correspond to what a \"Leo\" or \"Taurus\" is said to have. If a person chooses to manipulate their personality towards that trait, that's a choice, not a foregone conclusion.\n\nYou can test this. Read the types behind signs that are not those of your friends. Do this with an open mind. How many of the things said seem applicable to a friend? It's likely that you'll find many things seem like your friend in the other signs too, precisely because horoscope writing uses generalizations that can apply to all people in some way. It is simply the human desire to fit the pieces according to what we prefer (confirmation bias) that causes us to believe one set of grouped traits is more applicable than another.\nOne of the dilemmas that horoscopes have always had is in the case of twins. Twins seldom have the same fortune and many have different styles and personality. If horoscopes were real, they'd act exactly the same and have the same love life and fortune. This is simply not true!\n7. **Think about any previous loves, and the people that you get along with very well.** Do they all have the same sign (that is compatible with yours?) Not likely. Horoscopes cannot predict people's personality, and in turn, cannot predict people's compatibility with each other. Chemistry is a lot more complicated than the month when you were born!\n8. **Think of how silly the concept really is whenever you read a horoscope.** People born of the same month do not have the same personality, and you don't always see sparks with people who have a compatible sign. You will not have good fortune on a certain day because a magazine tells you so. Those magazines are just there to be fun and sell to people willing to believe the generalizations and conditional hope they offer.\n\nEven the more tailored horoscopes purchased online or through so-called horoscope \"experts\" are generalized. The people generating these horoscopes are good at reading people and generalizing about the types of personality traits that apply widely across a population. And within the space of week, every person is likely to have at least one good and one bad thing happen; it is very easy to fit the things that did occur to you into the sweeping statements that suggest such things will happen; in actual fact, it is you who have done the work of matching what has happened to you to the possibilities outlined in the horoscope. There is nothing quite so powerful as self conviction.\n\nHoroscopes are just opinions, like the majority of things human beings offer one another in life. Consider seriously just why planets and stars and the Sun would be intimately involved in your daily affairs. They are mass bodies doing what they are physically capable of, and that certainly does not include steering the events of human lives!\n9. **Go cold turkey.** Hopefully you have been convinced that horoscopes are not accurate. It will help if you just stop looking at them, and live your life on your own terms. Have fun, and don't worry about what a magazine column says!",

         "How to Rosin a Bow",
         "A bow without rosin will produce virtually no sound when it’s drawn across the strings of an instrument. But when rosin is added to your bow, it’s able to “catch” the strings and produce vibrations, which result in the music you hear. If you’re starting with new rosin, you’ll need to rough up the surface. Then you can make your first application to a new bow or regularly apply it to an old one.\n1. **Buy light rosin for smaller instruments.** There are different types of rosin, but the two most common are light rosin and dark rosin. Light rosin is harder, and not quite so sticky as dark rosin. It's sometimes called amber or summer rosin (for the time of year it's tapped), and it's appropriate for the higher strings, like violins and violas.\n2. **Choose dark rosin for a fuller sound for larger instruments.** Dark rosins, or winter rosins, tend to be very sticky. The stickier the rosin is, the fuller the sound will be. Select a dark rosin if you play a low-stringed, large instrument like the cello, for which a fuller sound is preferred.\n3. **Select boxed rosin for a durable, low-priced option.** Boxed rosin, as its name suggests, comes in a box. This makes it less prone to cracking and breaking. It's typically only available as a light or summer rosin and is usually a lower quality than cake rosin. But its low price tag makes it a good option for beginners.\n4. **Opt for cake rosin for a higher-quality product.** While cake rosin tends to be more expensive than boxed rosin, you're getting a purer, more high-quality rosin. It comes in a variety of colors, from amber to black, so you can select the best kind for your instrument.\n5. **Rub new rosin with fine-grit sandpaper to increase stickiness.** New rosin needs to be roughened in order for it to stick to your bow. Take a piece of sandpaper, around 220-grit, and rub it all over the top of the rosin block. Stop when you see the rosin producing dust.\nYou can also use a knife to score it and cut a crosshatch pattern into the top.\n6. **Tighten the bow.** Twist the screw at the end of the bow and tighten it until it appears straight and parallel with the hairs. Then slacken it just a little until you see the curve reappear in the wood. This is the best position for the bow to be in while you play.\nDon't touch the hairs or bounce them on your arm, as this will make them greasy and harder to play.\n7. **Hold the rosin in your left hand and the bow in your right hand.** It doesn't matter if you are right- or left-handed, as you always hold the bow in your right hand while playing. Cup the rosin block in your left hand, being sure to keep your fingers off the side you’ll be stroking the bow against.\n8. **Stroke the bow all the way across the rosin.** Run the bow along the rosin from the tip down to the frog (the part you hold with your hand), and then stroke it back again. Grasp the bow gently and press down just hard enough that the bow hairs produce some dust, but not so hard that you’re clenching the bow.\n9. **Repeat for 20 full strokes.** Stroke the bow back and forth across the rosin 20 times. Each time you finish a complete stroke (down and back), move the bow hairs over slightly to a new spot so that you don’t wear a line straight down the middle of the rosin.\nIf your rosin block is circular, rotate the circle slightly in between each stroke.\n10. **Play the instrument and listen for a full sound.** After twenty strokes, draw your bow along the strings of your instrument. Listen for a full, uninterrupted tone. If the sound is uneven or you feel the bow slide around on the strings, you’ll need more rosin.\n11. **Stroke the rosin 20 more times.** If the first 20 strokes didn’t produce the sound you want, repeat the process of stroking the bow over the rosin again. Add 20 more strokes, and then play the instrument to check the sound again.\nIf you’re still unsatisfied, continue adding twenty strokes at a time and then checking the sound.\n12. **Apply rosin once for every three to four hours you play.** If you’re playing about an hour a day, you should apply rosin to your bow hairs every three to four days. If you play significantly more than that, you may need to apply rosin daily before playing. For less frequent practicing, apply it less often.\n13. **Stroke the bow on the rosin about five times.** Once the bow has been rosined once, you won’t need to apply as much during each subsequent application. Stroke the bow back and forth over the rosin about five times before you begin practicing.\n14. **Wipe the bow hairs with a lint-free cloth after playing.** Rosin dust can accumulate on the bow after a while. Keep a lint-free cloth in your instrument case along with your rosin. At the end of each playing session, wipe the bow hairs from frog to tip once or twice to remove excess rosin dust.\n15. **Wipe rosin dust off the violin and bow stick.** Regularly check your instrument and bow stick for any rosin dust. Wipe if off with a lint-free cloth as soon as possible. Allowing the rosin to build up on your instrument can damage the finish, and you may need to pay for costly refinishing.",

         "How to Cut Glass",
         "Whether setting a window pane, creating a stained glass mosaic, or doing some other project, cutting glass is a handy skill that isn't difficult to pick up. With the right tools and a steady hand, anyone can start cutting standard glass at home.\n1. **Set up your work area.** You'll need a large flat surface, preferably one that is slightly soft and won't scratch your glass. Work in an area that is easy to clean.\n\nAvoid working over carpet because of the risk of getting glass shards on the floor if the glass breaks.\nFor their own safety keep pets and children away from your workspace and materials.\n2. **Clean the glass surface in the area where you plan to make cuts.** Any grime or silica on the glass can ruin your score. Wipe these away by running a cloth or your finger along the surface of the glass where you plan to score.\n3. **Obtain a glass cutter and some light oil.** Glass cutters are about the size of a pencil and use a diamond or a hardened wheel to mark a score into glass so that it can be broken cleanly along a line. You can buy cutting oil at a stained glass store or use a small amount of kerosene.\n4. **Measure and mark where you want to score.** The score must run from one edge of the glass to the other edge. You can write on the glass with a marker (preferably with a straight edge, if you are cutting a straight line. You can also mark on paper and place the glass on top of the paper.\n\nCut should not be very long. Scores longer than two feet have a high failure rate when breaking.\nMake sure your marks leave about six inches of glass on each side to grip and break. If you cut smaller pieces, you may need to use special tools, like pliers or a light hammer, to break off glass you can't get a hold of.\n5. **Dip the cutter in the oil and grasp it like a pencil.** An oiled cutter creates a smoother score line. Make sure to look at the wheel and make sure it is lined up the way you want the glass to cut.\n6. **Lay out a straight edge.** Use a yardstick or a normal desk ruler. You need something that has a thick enough profile that it won't conflict with the wheel on the cutter.\n7. **Apply pressure to the glass and you pull the cutter along the surface, rolling on the small carbide wheel.** Listen for a smooth sound like ripping silk. A gritty sound means that you are pushing too hard or that you did not oil your cutter. The less sound you make, the better your score will be.\n\nIf you push too hard (a very common mistake), your cut gets \"hot,\" meaning that it snaps and pops.\nYou are aiming to get a uniform score. If you are pressing too hard in one spot and perfectly in another, the glass will not break the way that you want it to. Microscopic imperfections in your score will cause your cut to go askew.\n8. **Run the cutter smoothly from one edge to the other.** Do not run back and forth over the line if you miss a spot.\n9. **Check your score.** You want a score that is not popping and is barely visible, if you were to wipe the oil away. It should look like a small scratch, nothing more. Make sure it runs completely from one edge to the other.\n10. **Grasp each side of the cut carefully in your hands.** Hold the glass as if you were trying to break a potato chip in half with two hands.\n11. **Apply minor pressure from the wrist to break the glass along your score.** Your elbows do not move. Simply twist your wrists (your right wrist will turn clockwise and your left will turn counterclockwise). Imagine that the score you made is half the depth of the glass and now you need to \"open it up\" by using the score as a weak spot. You're done as soon as you have two pieces of glass instead of the one you started with.\nWhen the glass breaks, it may simply start as a \"run.\" If it only runs an inch or so, apply a little more twisting pressure and it will continue to run.\n12. **Use fine sandpaper or a sharpening stone to remove the sharp edge.** This edge will be where the vertical edge meets the horizontal surfaces. Not only does sanding reduce the chances of your being cut, but sanded glass is less likely to chip along the edges and has some added strength.\n13. **Follow a pattern that connects to the edge.** If you are cutting a freehand shape, make sure you are breaking along lines that run from edge to edge. Mark your lines with a marker or set your glass over your pattern.\n14. **Use several straight lines to cut a sharp curve.** You should be able to score along gentle curves normally with a steady hand. For tighter curves, make a series of marks that run along part of the curve and skew off at a tangent outside the piece you want.\n15. **Flip the glass over and gently press on the center of your score from the backside.** You will start a run this way. Follow the run with light pressure and you can watch the glass separate where you scored it. If your score is too close to the edge of a piece of glass, it may run to the edge instead of along your score because that is the easiest path for the run to take.\n16. **Make some relief cuts to remove small pieces at a time instead of all at once.** The smaller the relief cuts, the more accurate your cut will be. Grip smaller pieces with pliers to snap them off.\n17. **Smooth your curved edges using a glass router.** This machine uses a spinning wheel with fine diamond chips as a grinder. Turn on the router and press your curve firmly against the grinder to smooth out your curve, then sand as normal.",

         "How to Learn Copywriting",
         "Whether you're hoping to work for a specific company or become a freelancer, there are lots of ways you can become a great copywriter. The best way to enhance your copywriting skills is to practice as much as possible, though doing things like reading books on copywriting or participating in online copywriting courses helps as well. Create a strong portfolio that showcases your copywriting skills, and be open to any job that comes your way.\n1. **Read copywriting books thoroughly.** There are endless books to choose from when it comes to the topic of copywriting. Look for books written by professional copywriters, or books that got excellent reviews and contain the material you’d like to learn. Try to read the books thoroughly to really grasp the content.\n\nTake notes while you’re reading so you remember key information, if desired.\nGreat copywriting books include The Copywriter's Handbook by Robert W. Bly, Breakthrough Copywriting by David Garfinkel, and The Idea Writers by Teressa Iezzi.\n2. **Consider investing in a copywriting course.** There are tons of online copywriting courses you can do from the comfort of your own home, and lots of them are even free of cost. If you’d rather learn copywriting in an actual classroom or community space, ask your local libraries, colleges, or community centers if they have copywriting courses you could take.\n\nType “online copywriting courses” into a search engine to peruse many online class options.\nYou can also do an online search for local in-person copywriting classes by typing “copywriting workshops near me” or something similar into the search engine.\n3. **Visit blogs that talk about people’s experiences copywriting.** Many successful copywriters create their own blogs, posting articles on copywriting tips and tricks, how to gain clients or testimonials, as well as many other topics. Look online for blogs on copywriting to hear more personalized advice from experts.\nPopular copywriting blogs include Copyblogger and ABC Copywriting.\n4. **Look at examples of copywriting everywhere you go.** Examples of copywriting are all around you—at the grocery store, on billboards, in your emails, and in commercials. Try to pay closer attention to any ads you see throughout the day, thinking about whether or not they make you want to buy the product and why.\n\nFor example, read an email from a store selling clothing, jewelry, art, or other sort of product. Notice the tactics they use for trying to get the reader’s attention.\nLook at an ad you got in the mail to analyze what makes it stand out as good or bad copy.\nIf there’s something you saw recently in an ad and are excited to buy, think about the reason why you’re excited to buy it and if it has anything to do with the copywriting.\n5. **Learn about fields related to copywriting for job ideas.** A great copywriter isn’t just good at grammar and spelling, they need knowledge of the other areas in which copywriting is prevalent. Try to learn tips about sales and marketing, storytelling, and consumer psychology by reading books and online articles on each topic.\n\nWhile you don't need to be an expert on these subjects, having general knowledge of them will help you as a copywriter.\nFor example, if you're hoping to write ads, knowing a little about marketing and how to get a consumer's attention will help your writing.\nConsider taking a free online or in-person course on one of the topics as well.\n6. **Write pieces of copy every day.** Even if you read all there is to know about copywriting, the best way to become great at it is to practice. Try to set aside time to write pieces of copy daily, even for just a few minutes. Use the tips you read about, and with lots of practice, you’ll get better each day.\n\nIf there’s a specific kind of copywriting you want to do, such as video scripts or social media, try to practice doing these types of copy.\nSet a timer for 10-30 minutes and focus on writing copy for the entire time.\n7. **Answer the important questions in your writing.** When you’re writing a piece of copy, your client or boss will likely want key information answered. This includes questions like “How would you describe the product?” or “What’s unique about it?” Use these questions to help provide the content for your writing.\n\nOther questions to consider answering are “What benefits does the product provide?” and “What features are included?”\nThink about what you would want to know about the product if you were the consumer.\n8. **Try to turn existing pieces of copy into something better.** This is a fun way to test out your creativity and copywriting skills. Find a copywriting example written by someone else, reading it over several times before trying to rewrite it yourself to make it better. Focus on grabbing the reader’s attention while keeping the writing condensed.\n\nFor example, buy a bag of chips and read the copy on the back of the bag. Now try to rewrite the copy, using the important facts while making the writing your own.\nEnhance the copy you find in your email inbox, trying to condense it into an attention-grabbing couple of sentences.\n9. **Focus on headlines that capture people’s attention.** The first couple of sentences are the most important when you’re writing copy. Your goal is to hold the reader’s attention and make them want to keep reading. Practice writing interesting headlines, making them funny, statistical, or inspiring.\n\nSome copywriting jobs will involve coming up with just a sentence that's supposed to capture the consumer's interest, such as slogans.\nCopy that engages the reader is often full of verbs and simple speech that is almost conversational.\n10. **Encourage people to take action in your writing.** Copywriting is all about persuading someone to do something, such as purchase the product you’re writing about. Try to summarize the important details of the subject of your writing in an interesting and informative way, making your copy a call to action.\n\nYour goal is to convince people that what you’re writing about is great and deserving of their attention.\nYou can do this by writing in actionable terms and giving your writing a sense of urgency.\n11. **Keep it short and to the point.** Not many people want to read long articles about something they’re not sure they care about yet, such as an email from a shoe company or a blog encouraging people to volunteer. Keep your writing short and sweet, giving the audience needed details in a condensed fashion.\n\nThere are examples of concise, well-written copy all around you, such as in magazines, on billboards, and on email signups.\nPractice writing copy of all different lengths, such as a short paragraph, a couple sentences, or even just a few words.\n12. **Create a portfolio of work to share with potential clients or bosses.** While degrees and recommendations are super helpful, your portfolio is the best example of your talents as a copywriter. To put a portfolio together, gather as many examples of your copywriting as possible. Pick out your best pieces, and these will be the ones you’ll show to possible clients or during job interviews to showcase your skills.\n\nAsk friends or family members if they need help with an email, website, or slogan so you can use this in your portfolio.\nIf you can’t find any possible clients to create copy for, create a made-up project for yourself to craft copy.\n13. **Look online on copywriting websites.** There are lots of websites geared towards freelance copywriters looking for work. On these sites, you can apply to tons of different copywriting jobs from people who are looking for a copywriter that suits their needs. Check out sites like Upwork or Flexjobs to find copywriting jobs you might like.\n\nFreelancer.com, iWriter, Guru, and SimplyHired are all great sites to find potential copywriting jobs.\nThe pay for each job on these sites will differ, but usually you start off being paid a small amount as a beginner and slowly gain more money with experience.\n14. **Answer people’s questions on social media or message boards.** If you come across someone on sites like Facebook, Craigslist, or other message boards asking questions related to copywriting, try to answer them. If you give good advice, they’re more likely to follow up and ask you to write copy for them.\nIf you’re talking to someone in person who asks a question about marketing or copywriting, try to answer it—you never know if they might end up hiring you to help them.\n15. **Gather testimonials to help brand yourself as a copywriter.** Whenever you finish a project for someone, ask them if they’ll write you a testimonial or review. Collecting testimonials from past clients, whether you worked for them in-person or online, will help you gather more clients in the future. Potential clients can read your testimonials and feel more confident that you’ll do a great job for them.\n16. **Do research about the brand before applying to jobs.** If you find a copywriting job you want to apply for, avoid just talking in vague terms about your copywriting experience. Look up and see what it is you might be writing about for them—this will not only help you create a more detailed cover letter, but it will help you in an interview to show that you’re truly interested in the job.\nA potential client or boss wants their copywriter to really know the product or idea that they’re selling, which is why it’s important to do some preliminary research beforehand.\n17. **Consider moving to a large city full of copywriting job opportunities.** If you don’t want to work remotely, it can be more difficult to find copywriting jobs, especially if you live in a small town or city. If you’re serious about copywriting, think about moving to a bigger city like New York, San Francisco, or Chicago where there are lots more job opportunities for copywriters.\nGo online to job search websites to find potential copywriting jobs in lots of different cities.",

         "How to Raise Hemoglobin",
         "Hemoglobin is a complex, iron-rich compound that is found in the blood.  Its main function is to carry oxygen to the cells of the different parts of the body from the lungs.  Another important function is to carry carbon dioxide away from the cells and transports it to the lungs.  Normal concentrations of hemoglobin in the blood are 13.5 to 18 g/dL in males and 12 to 16 g/dL in females. If your hemoglobin levels are low, you can work to raise them through making diet changes, trying natural remedies, and, if desired, using medical treatment. See Step 1 below to get started.\n1. **Eat iron-rich foods.** Iron is an important element in hemoglobin production—it helps your red blood cells deliver oxygen to the rest of your cells. If you’re suffering from low hemoglobin count, increase your consumption of iron-rich foods such as:\n\nSeafood like shrimp and clams\nLean meats, like chicken and beef\nTofu\nEggs\nGreen leafy vegetables like spinach\nCertain fruits like pineapple, apples, and pomegranates\nBeans and other legumes\nNuts like almonds. These should be eaten with precaution to avoid having an allergic reaction.\n2. **Increase your intake of vitamin C.** Vitamin C can facilitate iron absorption in the body.  It can be acquired by consuming these fruits and vegetables:\n\nOranges\nMangoes\nTangerines\nStrawberries\nCabbage\nBroccoli\nPeppers\nSpinach.\n3. **Eat more folic acid-rich foods.** Folic acids are vital in red blood cell production. Foods that are rich in folic acids include:\n\nSeeds\nPeanuts\nWheat germ\nSprouts\nBroccoli\nNuts\nIf your diet also includes lots of vitamin C, it is advised to eat a little more folic acid since Vitamin C makes the body excrete folic acid.\n4. **Eat whole grains.** Cereals, pastas and breads made from whole grains are enriched with iron. As we discussed, iron is a main component in the production of hemoglobin (the blood needs it to form the proteins). Eating these foods can up your iron levels, in turn upping your hemoglobin level.\nStay away from white breads, cereals, and pastas. These have had their nutrients processed out of them, also resulting in them losing their color. They offer little nutritional benefit and are often full of simple carbohydrates, or sugars.\n5. **Avoid foods that block iron.** Avoid iron blockers – these are food items that can block the body’s ability to absorb iron. Examples of iron-blocking foods and substances are:\n\nParsley\nCoffee\nMilk\nTea\nColas\nOver the counter antacids\nFiber and calcium-rich foods\nAlcohol like wine and beer\n6. **Try to eat less gluten.** Gluten is a form of protein that can be obtained from grains. For some individuals with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, the intake of foods containing gluten can damage the lining of the small intestine, which in turn can cause impairment in nutrient absorption including calcium, fat, folate and iron.\nNowadays, having a gluten-free diet doesn't have to be inconvenient. Many restaurants easily accommodate those that need to eat gluten-free and gluten is also labeled on many products in grocery stores.\n7. **Use withania and ashwagandha supplements to boost hemoglobin levels.** While still being researched and having no high-quality evidence currently, usage of these herbs may increase hemoglobin levels. They are used in ayurvedic medicine to treat iron deficiency anemia.\nTalk to your doctor about these supplements and how much is appropriate for you. Avoid using it while pregnant or breastfeeding. This may interact with several other medications.\n8. **Take nettle leaf to get a rich source of iron.** Nettle leaf is an herb that can be a rich source of iron and is historically used to treat arthritis. Iron plays an important role in producing and absorbing hemoglobin. The more iron you take, the more hemoglobin will be produced.\nNettle leaf is available in many vitamin and supplement stores and online. It is available as an oil, in capsule form, and even as a tea.\n9. **Try dong quai supplements.** While there is no quality data available, some small studies reveal that the consumption of dong quai can restore hemoglobin levels to a nearly normal range. It is traditionally utilized to treat premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menstrual symptoms, menstrual cramps, constipation and anemia. The cobalt in dong quai is thought to increase the hemoglobin content of your blood.\n\nDong quai is mostly available in capsule form, though it can also be used as an oil you can mix into your drinks. It is available at supplement stores, some pharmacies, and online.\nAvoid using while pregnant or breastfeeding.\n10. **Consider trying chitosan.** A small study demonstrated that patients with kidney failure that were given 45 mg of chitosan showed relatively reduced cholesterol levels and increased hemoglobin levels. Talk to your doctor about this natural remedy and if it's right for you.\n\nChitosan is available online and in special vitamin supplement stores. For the record, it's pronounced KITE-uh-san.\nChitosan should not be taken by people who are allergic to shellfish or mushrooms or by people who are taking Warfarin.\n11. **Talk to your doctor about taking supplements to increase your hemoglobin count.** Some patients are advised to take prescribed or over the counter medications or supplements to augment their levels of hemoglobin. However, be sure to only take supplements under your doctor's supervision, as they'll need to monitor your complete blood count and iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels over the course of treatment. Supplements may include:\n\n20-25mg of iron per day. This stimulates the production of hematin.\n400mcg of folic acid per day. This is taken to increase the production of red blood cells which transport hemoglobin.\n50-100mcg per day of vitamin B6. This functions also to increase red blood cell production.\n500-1000mg per day of vitamin B12. It is prescribed to enhance red blood cell count.\n1000mg per day of vitamin C. It is administered for red blood cell production as well.\n12. **Talk to your doctor about getting erythropoietin injections.** Erythropoietin is a hormone manufactured by the kidneys to promote the development of red blood cells by the bone marrow. Once the kidney cells sense that the oxygen level in the blood is too low it produces and releases erythropoietin to stimulate the bone marrow to generate more red blood cells. The increase in red blood cell count can also enhance the capacity of blood to carry oxygen.\n\nIn general, erythropoietin functions mainly to encourage the production of red blood cells and instigate the synthesis of hemoglobin (a component of the red blood cells that are in charge in transporting oxygen) .\nErythropoietin is administered either through the veins or via subcutaneous (external, fatty portion of the legs and thighs) injection.\n13. **Consider getting a blood transfusion if your hemoglobin levels are very low.** Blood transfusions are sometimes recommended by health care providers to improve hemoglobin count.\n\nPrior to transfusion, safety precautions are taken to ensure the quality and compatibility of blood. It is tested for signs of contamination which can cause adverse reactions to patients. Donated blood can contain infectious components for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis so proper screening is very important.\nAfter a thorough examination, the blood transfusion is given. It is administered through a central venous catheter or intravenous line in the arm over several hours.\nThe patient is then watched carefully for any untoward signs of blood transfusion such as difficulty of breathing, itchiness or rashes and an increase in body temperature.",

         "If you’re armed and at the Glenmont metro, please shoot me.\nMake it a headshot. Shoot me in the temple, aiming slightly downwards. I need the bullet to travel the shortest possible distance through my brain before it hits my hippocampus. If I’m lucky, the sensation of the gunshot ripping through my skull will only last a few decades.\n\nAs awful as this sounds, you’ll be doing me an enormous favor. Death by a headshot, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, is vastly better than the alternative.\nMy ordeal started over ten thousand years ago, at 10:15 this morning. I earn extra money by participating in drug trials. I’m a so-called “healthy subject” who takes experimental drugs to help assess side effects. Once it was a kidney drug. A few times it’s been something for blood pressure or cholesterol. This morning they told me the drug I took was a psychoactive substance intended to accelerate brain function.\nNone of the drugs I had tested so far have ever done anything for me, in the recreational sense. In other words, none of the drugs I’ve tested have given me a killer buzz, or mellowed me out, or anything. Maybe I’ve always ended up the placebo group, but nothing I’ve tested had affected me at all.\nToday’s drug was different. This shit worked. They gave me a pill at 10:15 and told me to hang out in the waiting room until they called me back for some tests. “Only about thirty minutes,” the research assistant told me. I flopped onto the waiting room couch and read a few articles from a copy of Psychology Today that was sitting on the coffee table. They hadn’t called me back when I finished the Psychology Today so I picked up a US News and read it cover-to-cover. Then I read an old Scientific American. What was taking them so damn long?\nI sluggishly turned my head to look at the wall clock. It was only 10:23 am. I had read all three magazines in eight minutes. I remember thinking this was going to be a long day. I was right.\n\nThe waiting room had little bookshelf with some used hardcovers on it. When I stood up to walk to the bookshelf it felt like my legs barely worked. It’s not that they were weak. They were just slow. It took a full minute just to stand up off the couch, and another minute to take two steps to the bookcase.\nI scanned the old books on the shelf and picked out a copy of Moby Dick. My arms had the same problems as my legs. Just reaching one foot in front of me to grab the book took a long time. I actually got bored just waiting for my hand to reach the spine of the book.\nI slogged back to the couch and collapsed onto it in a slow-motion fall that reminded me of the low-gravity hops of astronauts on the moon. I opened Moby Dick (slowly) and began reading. I started with Call me Ishmael and got as far as Ahab throwing his pipe into the sea (which was all the way to friggin chapter thirty) before they called me back.\n“How are you feeling?” the research assistant asked me.\n“I feel slow,” I said.\n\n“Actually, it’s the other way around. Everything seems slow because you’re so fast.”\n“But my legs. My arms. They’re moving in slow motion.”\n“Your body seems like it’s moving slowly because your brain is fast. Your brain is running ten or twenty times faster than normal. You are thinking and perceiving reality at an accelerated pace. But your body is still constrained by the laws of biomechanics. Frankly, you’re moving much faster than a normal person,” she pantomimed a jogging motion. “But your brain is running so much faster right now, that even your fast walk seems very slow to you.”\nI thought about my slow-motion flop onto the waiting room couch. Even if my muscles had slowed down, my body would still react to gravity the same way. But in the waiting room, I even fell in slow motion. Slow muscles couldn’t explain why gravity seemed weaker. My brain was going at warp ten. That’s how I managed to read three magazines and the first thirty chapters of Moby Dick in fifteen minutes.\n\nThey ran a series of tests on me. The physical tests were fun. They made me juggle three balls. Then four. Then six. I had no problem keeping six balls in the air because they seemed to be moving so slowly. It was boring, frankly, waiting for each ball to move through its arc so I could catch it (with my slow-motion hands) and toss it back into the air. They threw cheerios in the air and I caught them with chopsticks. They dropped a handful of coins and I counted the total value before they hit the ground.\nThe cognitive tests were less fun, but very illuminating. Finish a fifty-word word search (three seconds). Solve an intricate maze drawn onto a poster-sized paper (two seconds). View a slide show projected at ten images per second and answer detailed questions about what I saw (95% correct).\nThey told me I measured over 250 on the Knopf scale. Apparently, that’s deep into the superhuman range of thinking speeds.\nThen they sent me home. “It’ll wear off in a few hours,” they said. “Which will seem like days to you. Try to use the residual effects to get some work done. Catch up on work emails while you’re still in high-speed mode!”\nThe ride home was horrible. It was only three metro stops, and in real-world time, it only took about thirty-five minutes. But in my drug-accelerated hyper-time, it felt like days. Days. Just walking out of the medical research suite to the elevator seemed like it took an hour. I sprinted out of the office, willing my legs to push me faster. But, the laws of biomechanics held me prisoner. As accelerated as my brain was, I couldn’t do anything to make my legs work faster.\nThe huge disconnect between my body and mind made it extremely difficult to judge how and when to slow down, turn, or rotate my body. I had basically turned into giant, slow-motion spaz. I misjudged my speed and rammed into the wall by the elevator button at a pretty good speed. Even though I could see the wall coming at me, I couldn’t make my finger, outstretched to hit the elevator button, move away fast enough and I jammed it against the wall. Hard. The pain was intense. If my brain had been running at regular speed, it probably only would have hurt for thirty seconds or so. But in my accelerated state, the intense pain seemed to last for half an hour. Forty-five minutes maybe.\nThe elevator ride was horrible. It felt like I spent four or five hours just descending seven floors, with nothing to look at but the interior of the elevator car.\nI sprinted to the metro station. I have to admit, this part was almost fun. Even though my body moved at, what seemed to me, super-slow speed, I could still carefully choose how and where to place my feet, swing my arms, and turn my torso. It only took a block or two to getting used to having a brain that ran two dozen times faster than my body. Then I basically sprint-danced the rest of the way, twisting and juking between people on the sidewalk and dodging moving cars with inches (a.k.a. minutes) of clearance.\nI spent an hour, in my time frame, descending into the subway and running to the platform. Endless tedium waiting the six minutes for the red-line train to arrive. Although there was more to look at on the metro platform than inside the elevator, it was still intensely boring. I should have stolen that copy of Moby Dick.\nThe red-line train roared into the station in slow-motion. The normally high-pitched squeal of its brakes was frequency shifted by my high-speed mind to a long low tone, like a monotone Tuba solo.\nIt wasn’t just the squealing subway train that was three octaves lower than normal. All sound was slowed to the point of near inaudibility. Voices were gone, shifted below the threshold frequency of my hearing. I did manage to hear a screaming baby on my subway car – her shrieks slowed to sound like whale songs. Sharp sounds like a car horns and trucks bouncing over potholes were low, muddied roars like distant thunder.\nBack at the research offices, I could still hear and communicate with the research staff. But now verbal communication with anyone would be impossible. The effects of the drug were still intensifying.\nI spent what seemed like days on that fucking red-line train. Days. Listening to the whale-song of the screaming baby and the Tuba solo of the brakes. Where ordinary voices were frequency-shifted out of my audio range, smells didn’t seem to be affected. I never became nose-blind to the body odor, the stench of the train’s brakes, and mélange of farts and other smells wafting through the metro car.\nI finally got back to my apartment. Sprinting through my open door and into the front hall at full speed was like a slow, relaxing drift down a lazy river.\nI was relieved to be home. At least I had stuff I could do there. I picked up the book I was reading – One Hundred Years of Solitude – and finished it. Despite turning the pages so quickly that I tore many of them, it seemed like most of the time I spent finishing the book was spent on page turning and not actually reading. Three minutes had passed since I got home.\nI tried surfing the Internet (my GOD it takes a long time for computers to boot these days) but it was too frustratingly slow. Hours (seemingly) to load each new page, and a fraction of a second to read it. A hundred articles in my news feed read and just three more minutes done.\nI dipped into my pile of yet-to-be-read books and finished two more. Four more minutes had passed.\nI decided to try to sleep off the remaining effects of the drug. Unfortunately, whatever part of my mind is responsible for perception, the part that’s been accelerated to hyper speeds by the drug, isn’t the same as the part that governs sleep. Despite being awake for what I perceived as days, my physical brain still thought it was 1:25 pm. It was not ready for sleep.\nNevertheless, I tried to sleep. I walked to my bedroom (a slow 45-minute drift through my apartment) and flung myself into bed (lazily falling like a feather onto the mattress). I closed my eyes and lay there for hours and hours (10 minutes of reality time) before giving up. Sleep would not come. I was facing what was going to feel like days, or maybe even weeks of being trapped in a slow-motion prison.\nSo I took an Ambien.\nThe sensation of the pill and the splash of water I used to swallow it sliding my throat was sickening. A lump that blocked my breathing, moving like a slug down my esophagus.\nI read a book. Ten minutes had passed. I read another. Eighteen minutes since I took the Ambien. I threw the book across the room in disgust at my situation. The book slowly pirouetted and spun through the air, like a leaf blowing in a breeze. It hit the wall with a long, faint rumble – the only sound I had head for what seemed like hours – then drifted to the floor like a flip-flop sinking in a swimming pool.\n\nThe force of gravity hadn’t changed since I took the pill. The laws of physics were the same. It was just my perception of time that had gone wackadoo. This meant I could use the speed things seemed to fall as a way of judging the effects of the drug. Based on how long it took the book to drift to the floor, I estimated the effects of the drug were still intensifying.\nI read a magazine. I turned on the television – I clearly saw each frame of video like I was watching a slideshow. Frustrated, I turned the television off.\nI read some more. The first two books of Churchill’s A History of the English-Speaking Peoples. Not exactly a light read. Frankly, I hated it. But given the hours of tedium it would take to go get another book off my bookshelf, just sitting on the couch and reading Churchill was better. Or at least less worse.\nIt had now been thirty-five minutes since I took the Ambien. I lay down on the couch and closed my eyes. Time passed. I inhaled – a hours long process. Time passed. I exhaled for more hours.\nSleep. Would. Not. Come.\nI needed a new plan. I decided to go back to the offices where they gave me the drug. Maybe they would have something that could counteract its effects. Or at least something to knock me out until it wore off.\nI exited my apartment as fast as possible – taking hours in my time-frame to do so. I didn’t even bother locking the door. It would have taken too long.\nDown the stairs (it’s faster than the elevator if you run), through the lobby, out the front door and onto the street. These few things felt like a long day at the office.\nSprinting down the street, dancing and weaving between pedestrians with, what must have looked to them, superhuman dexterity. Down the first flight of stairs at the metro. Across the landing. Another hour. Then on to the second flight of stairs. That’s when the Ambien hit me.\nThe Ambien didn’t make me sleepy. Not at all. Instead, it must have had a severe cross-reaction with the experimental drug I took this morning. I was bounding down the second flight of stairs, moving in slow motion, but still making perceptible progress. Then, wham – everything stopped.\nThe dull roar of the street and metro noise ceased, replaced by the most perfect silence I’ve ever experienced. My downwards motion seemed to completely freeze. Before the Ambien kicked in, my perception of time was maybe a few hundred times slower than real-time. After the Ambien took effect, time moved thousands of times slower. Every second seemed like days to me. Even just moving my eyes to focus on a new point was like an impossibly slow scroll across my visual field.\nOver the course of the afternoon, I learned how to walk, run, and jump when my mind ran hundreds of times faster than my body. But with another four or five orders of magnitude of slow-down caused by the Ambien, body control was almost impossible. I fell on the stairs. Even though I was all-but-frozen in mid-step, controlling my muscles was impossible. I commanded my foot forwards for hours, then backwards for hours more when it seemed like I would miss the next step. Hours attempting to adjust the angle of my ankle, then re-adjusting when it felt wrong.\nDespite these efforts, I rolled my ankle on the next step. The pain wasn’t at all mitigated by the slowness. Hours of increasing strain on my bent ankle. The nerve signals that send pain into the brain must work differently than the nerves in my ear. Sonic energy was spread out over time, diluted until it was imperceptible. Pain flowed into my brain undiluted by the change in my perception of time. Hours and hours of increasing weight on my turned ankle turned into hours of increasing pain upon increasing pain.\nI pitched forwards, my high-speed mind completely unable to control my low-speed body. I drifted downwards for days, managing to rotate my torso enough to keep my head from impacting the ground first. I eventually landed on my right shoulder. At first the impact wasn’t even noticeable. Then I felt a slight pressure in my shoulder as it came in contact with the ground. The pressure grew, bringing increasing pain, for hour upon hour. My shoulder finally gave out, popping out of its socket with an endless sickening tug.\nI came to a stop days later, crumpled onto the ground, staring at the ceiling. The pain in my shoulder still screaming with the intensity of a fresh violent injury. I had plenty of time to think during that fall. If every second seemed like days to me, then each minute of real-world time would be like years. Even if the drug cleared out of my system in the next two or three hours, this nightmare would seem to last centuries.\nBy the time I hit the ground, I had a plan. I would somehow get to the platform and throw myself in front of a train.\nI twisted onto my hands and knees. Days of my dislocated shoulder crying for relief. I misjudged my rotation and rolled onto my back. I tried again, collapsing onto my face as I tried to figure out how to control a body that moved slower than grass grew. Weeks of effort were finally rewarded with success – I stabilized on my hands and knees.\nIf just getting on all fours was this difficult, I figured that walking or running was completely out of the question. So I crawled. I crawled through the metro tunnel. The dumb looks on the faces in the crowd lingered on me for weeks. I crawled under the turnstyle and onto the escalator.\nThe escalator spilled the rush-hour crowd onto the platform at the same speed a glacier spills ice into the sea. I looked out over the crowded platform during my interminable downward ride. The train status sign said the next train wouldn’t arrive for twenty minutes. Twenty minutes was like a year to me. I’d have to spend a year on the metro platform, waiting to die.\nI crawled off the escalator, enduring days of stupid expressions on the commuters’ faces. I crawled a few feet to a concrete bench and curled up next to it, trying to find a position to lessen the pain in my shoulder. Then my problem with time got worse. Impossibly worse.\nThe massive slowdown on the stairs was just the beginning of the interaction between the experimental drug and the Ambien. It fully hit me while I was curled up by the bench. I blinked. Years of darkness followed. Sound was already gone, and with my blink, sight was gone as well. All that existed was the pain from my fall.\nMy hyper-accelerated mind wasted no time compensating for the lack of sensory input. Voices spoke to me. They sung to me in languages that never existed. Patterns and faces and colors came and went in my mind’s eye. I recalled my whole life, and imagined living another. I forgot English. I settled into a profound despair. I spoke to God. I became God. I imagined a new universe and brought it to life with my thoughts. Then I did it all again. And again.\nMy eyes opened with geologic slowness. A faint glow. Weeks. A slit of light. Weeks. A narrow view of the metro platform – ankles of the commuters near me and an advertisement on the opposite wall.\nI extracted my phone from my pocket. A project that spanned decades. How can I even explain the boredom? The pain in my shoulder is nothing compared to the boredom. Every thought I can think, I have thought hundreds of times already. The view of ankles and advertisements never changes. Never. The boredom is so intense it’s tangible – like a solid object of metal and stone wedged into my skull. Inescapable.\nWhat are my options? If I crawl and fall onto the tracks without an oncoming train to crush me, I won’t die. I’ll experience even more pain from the four-foot fall, but I’ll most likely be rescued by some do-gooder on the platform and unable to act when the train finally does arrive. My suffering in that scenario will be endless.\nSo I wait for the train. So I can throw myself under it. When it finally hits me, I will experience the pain of being ripped to pieces for centuries until finally, the light of life leaves my brain, and my experience ends.\nI’ve lived hundreds of lifespans at the foot of this bench. I am far older, in spirit, than any human who has ever lived. Most of my life experience has been a snapshot of pain huddled on the floor of a subway platform, with an unchanging view of ankles and advertisements.\nThis post is my plan B. My Hail Mary. My long-shot. I’ve spent lifetimes typing and posting this message in the hope that someone will read it and become convinced that my suffering must end. Someone on this platform right now. Someone who will find the man curled under the bench, the man who crawled down the escalator, and kill him as swiftly as possible. A bullet to the temple.\nIf you’re armed and at the Glenmont metro, please shoot me.\n",

         "  I don’t know when you’re going to read this, but I can tell you when it started: I was out for a walk alone in the woods when the entity came for me. It was beyond a blur. It was, for lack of a better term, absence of meaning. Where it hid, there were no trees; where it crept closer, there was no grass; through the arc it leapt at me, there was no breeze of motion. There was no air at all.\nAs it struck, I felt the distinct sensation of claws puncturing me somewhere unseen; somewhere I’d never felt before. My hands and arms and legs and torso seemed fine and I wasn’t bleeding, but I knew I’d been injured somehow. As I fearfully ran back home, I could tell that I was less. I was vaguely tired, and it was hard to focus at times.\n\nThe solution at that early stage was easy: a big cup of coffee helped me feel normal again.\nFor a while, that subtle drain on my spirit became lost in the ebb and flow of caffeine in my system. You could say my life began that week, actually, because that was when I met Mar. She and I got along great, though, to be honest, I’m pretty sure I fell in love with her over the phone before we even met.\nIt was almost as if the strong emotions of that first week made the entity fight back—it was still with me, latched on to some invisible part of my being.\nThe first few incidents were minor, and I hardly worried about them. The color of a neighbor’s car changed from dark blue to black one morning, and I stared at it before shaking my head and shrugging off the difference. Two days later, at work, a coworker’s name changed from Fred to Dan. I carefully asked around, but everyone said his name had always been Dan. I figured I’d just been mistaken.\nThen, as ridiculous as this sounds, I was peeing in my bathroom at home when I suddenly found myself on a random street. I was still in my pajamas, pants down, and urinating—but now in full view of a dozen people at a bus stop. Horrified, I pulled up my clothes and ran before someone called the cops. I did manage to get home, but the experience forced me to admit that I was still in danger. The entity was doing something to me, and I didn’t understand how to fight back.\n\nMar showed up that evening, but she had her own key.\n“Hey,” I asked her with confusion. “How’d you get a key?”\nShe just laughed. “You’re cute. Are you sure you’re okay with this?” She opened a door and entered a room full of boxes. “I know living together is a big step, especially when we’ve only been dating three months.”\nLiving together? I’d literally just met her the week before. Thing was, my mother had always called me a smart cookie for a reason. I knew when to shut my yap. Instead of causing a scene, I told her everything was fine—and then I went straight to my room and began investigating.\nMy things were just as I had left them with no sign of a three month gap in habitation, but I did find something out of the ordinary: the date. I shivered angrily as I processed the truth.\n\nThe entity had eaten three months of my life.\nWhat the hell was I facing? What kind of creature could consume pieces of one’s soul like that? I’d missed the most exciting part of a new relationship, and I would never understand any shared stories or in-jokes from that period. Something absurdly precious had been taken from me, and I was furious.\nThat fury helped suppress the entity. I never imbibed alcohol. I drank coffee religiously. I checked the date every time I woke up. For three years, I managed to live each day while observing nothing more than minor alterations. A social fact here and there—someone’s job, how many kids they had, that sort of thing—the layout of nearby streets, the time my favorite television show aired, that kind of thing. Always, those changes reminded me the creature still had its claws sunk into my spirit. Not once in three years did I ever let myself zone out.\nOne day, I grew careless. I let myself get really into the season finale of my favorite show. It was gripping; a fantastic story. Right at the height of the action, a young boy came up to my lounger and shook my arm.\n\nSurprised, I asked, “Who are you? How did you get in here?”\nHe laughed and smiled brightly. “Silly Daddy!”\nMy heart sank in my chest. I knew immediately what had happened. After a few masked questions, I discovered that he was two years old—and that he was my son.\nThe agony and heartache filling my chest was nearly unbearable. Not only had I missed the birth of my son, I would never see or know the first years of his life. Mar and I had obviously gotten married and started a family in the time I’d lost, and I had no idea what joys or pains those years contained.\nIt was snowing outside. Holding my sudden son in my lap, I sat and watched the flakes fall outside. What kind of life was this going to be if slips in concentration could cost me years? I had to get help.\nThe church had no idea what to do. The priests didn’t believe me, and told me I had a health issue rather than some sort of possession.\nThe doctors didn’t have any clue. Nothing showed up on all their scans and tests, but they happily took my money in return for nothing.\nBy the time I ran out of options, I’d decided to tell Mar. There was no way to know what this all looked like from her side. What was I like when I wasn’t there? Did I still take our son to school? Did I still do my job? Clearly, I did, because she seemed to be none the wiser, but I still had a horrible feeling that something must have been missing in her life when I wasn’t actually home inside my own head.\nBut the night I set up a nice dinner in preparation, she arrived not by unlocking the front door, but by knocking on it. I answered, and found that she was in a nice dress.\nShe was happily surprised by the settings on the table. “A fancy dinner for a second date? I knew you were sweet on me!”\nThank the Lord I knew when to keep my mouth shut. If I’d gone on about being married and having a son, she might have run for the hills. Instead, I took her coat and sat down for our second date.\nThrough carefully crafted questions, I managed to deduce the truth. This really was our second date. She saw relief and happiness in me, but interpreted that as dating jitters. I was just excited to realize that the entity wasn’t necessarily eating whole portions of my life. The symptoms, as I was beginning to understand them, were more like the consequences of a shattered soul. The creature had wounded me; broken me into pieces. Perhaps I was to live my life out of order, but at least I would actually get to live it.\nAnd so it went for a few years—from my perspective. While minor changes in politics or geography would happen daily, major shifts in my mental location only happened every couple months. When I found myself in a new place and time in my life, I just shut up and listened, making sure to get the lay of the land before doing anything to avoid making mistakes. On the farthest-flung leap yet, I met my six-year-old grandson, and I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said, “Writer.” I told him that was a fine idea.\nThen, I was back in month two of my relationship with Mar, and I had the best night with her on the riverfront. When I say the best, I mean the best. Knowing how special she would become to me, I asked her to move in. I got to live through what I’d missed the first go-around, and I came to understand that I was never mentally absent. I would always be there—eventually. When we were moving her boxes in, she stopped for a moment and said she marveled at my great love, as if I’d known her for a lifetime and never once doubted she was the one.\nThat was the first time I’d truly laughed freely and wholeheartedly since the entity had wounded me. She was right about my love for her, but for exactly the reason she’d considered a silly romantic analogy. I had known her my whole life, and I’d come to terms with my situation and found peace with it. It wasn’t so bad to have sneak peeks at all the best parts ahead.\nBut of course I wouldn’t be writing this if it hadn’t gotten worse. The entity was still with me. It had not wounded me and departed like I’d wanted to believe. The closest I can describe my growing understanding was that the creature was burrowing deeper into my psyche, fracturing it into smaller pieces. Instead of months between major shifts, I began having only weeks. Once I noticed that trend, I feared my ultimate fate would be to jump between times in my life heartbeat by heartbeat, forever confused, forever lost. Only an instant in each time meant I would never be able to speak with anyone else, never be able to hold a conversation, never express or receive love.\nAs the true depth of that fear came upon me, I sat in an older version of me and watched the snow falling outside. That was the one constant in my life: the weather didn’t care who I was or what pains I had to face. Nature was always there. The falling snow was always like a little hook that kept me in a place; the pure emotional peace it brought was like a panacea on my mental wounds, and I’d never yet shifted while watching the pattern of falling white and thinking of the times I’d gone sledding or built a snow fort as a child.\nA teenager touched my arm. “Grandpa?”\n“Eh?” He’d startled me out of my thoughts, so I was less careful than usual. “Who are you?”\nHe half-grinned, as if not sure whether I was joking. Handing me a stack of papers, he said, “It’s my first attempt at a novel. Would you read it and tell me what you think?”\nAhh, of course. “Pursuing that dream of being a writer, I see.”\nHe burned bright red. “Trying to, anyway.”\n“All right. Run off, I’ll read this right now.” The words were blurry, and, annoyed, I looked for glasses I probably had for reading. Being old was terrible, and I wanted to leap back into a younger year—but not before I read his book. I found my glasses in a sweater pocket, and began leafing through. Mar puttered in and out of the living room, still beautiful, but I had to focus. I didn’t know how much time I would have there.\nIt seemed that we had relatives over. Was it Christmas? A pair of adults and a couple kids I didn’t recognize tromped through the hallway, and I saw my son, now adult, walk by with his wife on the way out the door. As a group, the extended family began sledding outside.\nFinally, I finished reading the story, and I called out for my grandson. He rushed down the stairs and into the living room. “How was it?”\n“Well, it’s terrible,” I told him truthfully. “But it’s terrible for all the right reasons. You’re still a young man, so your characters behave like young people, but the structure of the story itself is very solid.” I paused. “I didn’t expect it to turn out to be a horror story.”\nHe nodded. “It’s a reflection of the times. Expectations for the future are dismal, not hopeful like they used to be.”\n“You’re far too young to be aware like that,” I told him. An idea occurred to me. “If you’re into horror, do you know anything about strange creatures?”\n“Sure. I read everything I can. I love it.”\nWarily, I scanned the entrances to the living room. Everyone was busy outside. For the first time, I opened up to someone in my life about what I was experiencing. In hushed tones, I told him about my fragmented consciousness.\nFor a teenager, he took it well. “You’re serious?”\n“Yes.”\nHe donned the determined look of a grown man accepting a quest. “I’ll look into it, see what I can find out. You should start writing down everything you experience. Build some data. Maybe we can map your psychic wound.”\nWow. “Sounds like a plan.” I was surprised. That made sense, and I hadn’t expected him to have a serious response. “But how will I get all the notes in one place?”\n“Let’s come up with somewhere for you to leave them,” he said, frowning with thought. “Then I’ll get them, and we can trace the path you’re taking through your own life, see if there’s a pattern.”\nFor the first time since the situation had gotten worse, I felt hope again. “How about under the stairs? Nobody ever goes under there.”\n“Sure.” He turned and left the living room.\n\nI peered after him. I heard him banging around near the stairs.\nFinally, he returned with a box, laid it on the carpet, and opened it to reveal a bursting stack of papers. He exclaimed, “Holy crap!”—but of course, being a teenager, he didn’t really say crap.\nTaken aback, I blinked rapidly, forgiving his cussing because of the shock. “Did I write those?”\nHe looked up at me with wonder. “Yeah. Or, you will. You still have to write them and put them under the stairs after this.” He gazed back down at the papers—then covered the box. “So you probably shouldn’t see what they say. That could get weird.”\nThat much I understood. “Right.”\nHe gulped. “There are like fifty boxes under there, all filled up like this. Deciphering these will take a very long time.” His tone dropped to deadly seriousness. “But I will save you, grandpa. Because I don’t think anyone else can.”\nTears flowed down my cheeks then, and I couldn’t help but sob once or twice. I hadn’t realized how lonely I’d become in my shifting prison of awareness until I finally had someone who understood. “Thank you. Thank you so much.”\nAnd then I was young again, and at work on a random Tuesday. Once the sadness and relief faded, anger and determination replaced them. After I finished my work, I grabbed some paper and began writing. While the weeks shifted around me, while those weeks became days, and then hours, I wrote every single spare moment about when and where I thought I was. I put them under the stairs out of order; my first box was actually the thirtieth, and my last box was the first. Once I had over fifty boxes written from my perspective—and once my shifting became a matter of minutes—I knew it was up to my grandson to take it from there.\nI put my head down and stopped looking. I couldn’t stand the river of changing awareness any longer. Names and places and dates and jobs and colors and people were all wrong and different.\nI’d never been older. I sat watching the snow fall. A man of at least thirty that I vaguely recognized entered the room. “Come on, I think I finally figured it out.”\nI was so frail that moving was painful. “Are you him? Are you my grandson?”\n“Yes.” He took me to a room filled with strange equipment and sat me in a rubber chair facing a large mirror twice the height of a man. “The pattern finally revealed itself.”\n“How long have you worked on this?” I asked him, aghast. “Tell me you didn’t miss your life like I’m missing mine!”\nHis expression was both stone cold and furiously resolute. “It’ll be worth it.” He brought two thin metal rods close to my arm and then nodded at the mirror. “Look. This shock is carefully calibrated.”\nThe electric zap from his device was startling, but not painful. In the mirror, I saw a rapid arcing light-silhouette appear above my head and shoulder. The electricity moved through the creature like a wave, briefly revealing the terrible nature of what was happening to me. A bulging leech-like mouth was wrapped around the back of my head, coming down to my eyebrows and touching each ear, and its slug-like body ran over my shoulder and into my very soul.\nIt was a parasite.\nAnd it was feeding on my mind.\nMy now-adult grandson held my hand as I took in the horror. After a moment, he asked, “Removing it is going to hurt very badly. Are you up for this?”\nFearful, I asked, “Is Mar here?”\nHis face softened. “No. Not for a few years now.”\nI could tell from his reaction what had happened, but I didn’t want it to be true. “How?”\n“We have this conversation a lot,” he responded. “Are you sure you want to know? It never makes you feel better.”\nTears brimmed in my eyes. “Then I don’t care if it hurts, or if I die. I don’t want to stay in a time where she’s not alive.”\nHe made a sympathetic noise of understanding and then returned to his machines to hook several wires, diodes, and other bits of technology to my limbs and forehead. While he did so, he talked. “I’ve worked for two decades to figure this out, and I’ve had a ton of help from other researchers of the occult. This parasite doesn’t technically exist in our plane. It’s one of the lesser spawns of µ¬ßµ, and it feeds on the plexus of mind, soul, and quantum consciousness/reality. When details like names and colors of objects changed, you weren’t going crazy. The web of your existence was merely losing strands as the creature ate its way through you.”\nI didn’t fully understand. I looked up in confusion as he placed a circlet of electronics like a crown on my head in exact line with where the parasite’s mouth had ringed me. “What’s µ¬ßµ?”\nHe paused his work and grew pale. “I forgot that you wouldn’t know. You’re lucky, believe me.” After a deep breath, he began moving again, and placed his fingers near a few switches. “Ready? This is carefully tuned to make your nervous system extremely unappetizing to the parasite, but it’s basically electro-shock therapy.”\nI could still see Mar’s smile. Even though she was dead, I’d just been with her moments ago. “Do it.”\nThe click of a switch echoed in my ears, and I almost laughed at how mild the electricity was. It didn’t feel like anything—at least at first. Then, I saw the mirror shaking, and my body within that image convulsing. Oh. No. It did hurt. Nothing had ever been more painful. It was just so excruciating that my mind hadn’t been able to immediately process it.\nAs my vision shook and fire burned in every nerve in my body, I could see the reflected trembling light-silhouette of the parasite on my head as it writhed in agony equal to mine. It had claws—six clawed lizard-like limbs under its leech-like body—and it cut into me in an attempt to stay latched on.\nThe electricity made my memories flare.\nMar’s smile was foremost, lit brightly in front of a warm fire as the snow fell past the window behind her. The edges of that memory began lighting up, and I realized that my life was one continuous stretch of experience—it was only the awareness of it that had been fragmented by that feasting evil on my back.\nI’d never managed to be there for the birth of my son. I’d jumped around it a dozen times, but never actually lived it. For the first time, I got to hold Mar’s hand and be there for her.\nNo. No! That moment had shifted seamlessly into holding her hand as she lay in a hospital bed for a very different reason. Not this! God, why? It was so merciless to make me remember this. I broke down in tears as nurses rushed into the room. I didn’t want to know. I didn’t want to experience it. I’d seen all the good parts, but I hadn’t wanted the worst part—the inevitable end that all would one day face.\nIt wasn’t worth it. It was tainted. All that joy was given back ten thousand fold as pain.\nThe fire in my body and in my brain surged to sheer white torture, and I screamed.\nMy scream faded into a surprised shout as the machines and electricity and chair faded away. Snow was no longer falling around my life; I was out in the woods on a bright summer day.\nOh God.\nI turned to see the creature approaching me. It was the same absence of meaning; the same blank on reality. It crept forward, just like before—but, this time, it hissed and turned away. I stood, astounded at being young again and freed from the parasite. My grandson had actually done it! He’d made me an unappetizing meal, so the predator of mind and soul had moved on in search of a different snack.\nI returned home in a daze.\nAnd while I was sitting there processing all that had happened, the phone rang. I looked at it in awe and sadness. I knew who it was. It was Marjorie, calling for the first time for some trivial reason she’d admit thirty years later was made up just to talk to me.\nBut all I could see was her lying in that hospital bed dying. It was going to end in unspeakable pain and loneliness. I would become an old man, left to sit by myself in an empty house, his soulmate gone long before him. At the end of it all, the only thing I would have left: sitting and watching the falling snow.\nBut now, thanks to my grandson, I would also have my memories. It would be a wild ride, no matter how it ended.\nOn a sudden impulse, I picked up the phone. With a smile, I asked, “Hey, who’s this?”\nEven though I already knew.\nAuthor’s note: Together, my grandfather and I did set out to write the tale of his life. Unfortunately, his Alzheimer’s disease progressed rapidly, and we were never able to finish. He’s still alive, but I imagine that, mentally, he is in a better place than the nursing home. I like to think he’s back in his younger days, living life and being happy, because the reality is much colder. It’s snowing today; he loves the snow. When I visited him, he didn’t recognize me, but he did smile as he sat looking out the window.\n",

         "I’ve been blind since birth. As I grew up, everything was described to me in such vivid detail that I didn’t even realize why it was that important to see, especially having no reference point to compare it. We lived in a single-floor ranch house, that’s what Father told me. In my mind, of course, I could see, although unlike how a sighted person could. I had spatial awareness. I knew where my bedroom was, where the bathroom, living room and kitchen were. Each wall had its own texture. I don’t know if that was done on purpose, or if I could feel things others never noticed.\nI rarely fell over. Only if Father, or one of the visitors, put something somewhere they shouldn’t have. It was usually the visitors, and Father would shout.\n\nThey visited infrequently, and only briefly when they did. Father said I shouldn’t speak to them, that it unsettled him. He’d worry when I saw something he didn’t, saw it with my ears or by touch.\nEllie was the first. She seemed very sweet. She asked me my name and why my face was so messed up. She was in the living room. I could hear where she sat from her breaths. Harsh nasal sounds, as if her nose was blocked. When father had a cold, he’d always breath through his mouth, big labored breaths, as he wasn’t used to it.\nWhen people mentioned my face, I always touched it, trying to work out why it was so strange to them. When I asked if I could touch theirs, there was always a pause. I guessed sighted people never did that. Why would they need to?\nWhen I asked Ellie if I could touch her face, she reluctantly agreed, but moments later Father entered the room and asked me who I was speaking to. I told him, “Nobody.” He would always punish me when I spoke about them. I think it scared him. He’d take my arm and march me off. I’d be knocked off-balance and disoriented, to the point where when he finally set me down, my hands would frantically search my surroundings until I knew where I was. It was usually my bedroom, though every now and then he’d leave me outside, in the middle of nowhere. That was the worst. I would be lost and scared. He told me about the road that ran in front of the house, and explained that the sounds I heard were cars, that they’d kill me if they touched me. Those sounds were my only means of recognizing my surroundings. I waited until I heard one, and then knew which way to run back to the house.\nI heard Ellie that evening. She whispered to me, saying she was scared. I whispered back, but she didn’t hear.\n\nI asked Father about Ellie. He didn’t want to talk about her. I asked him why. He didn’t reply. When I told him that she asked about my face, he asked me how I responded. I told him I wanted to touch hers. He laughed, though I knew he wasn’t happy. I could hear the difference. When you laugh for pleasure, your mouth is wide open. When you pretend, your mouth is almost closed. To me, the difference is obvious.\nIt wasn’t until I was older that he explained.\nHe said we lived in a special place, connected to the “other world”. That sometimes dead people slip through, people who died in pain and wanted to reach the living. He explained that because I couldn’t see, I was able to tune in to that. That they knew I was listening when others weren’t. He said I had to ignore it. Otherwise, he told me, they’d latch on and never leave me. All the dead want is to be alive again, he said. It was dangerous, and they would trick me. He said he knew how to deal with them, but he couldn’t help if they became attached to me.\nAlex appeared to me a few years later. She told me she was lost and didn’t know where she was. I told her I wasn’t allowed to speak to her. Still, she pleaded for help. I kept quiet, knowing what would happen if I said anything. “Did you speak to them?” Father asked. Though I was upset, I told him no. I wished I could help her. I knew what it was like to be lost, and it scared me.\nAlex didn’t whisper to me at all. I’d ignored her, and she ignored me. Father saved me, and I was thankful.\n\nAfter Alex, I knew what I needed to do, so I did it. The spirits stopped bothering me after that, for a very long time. That was, until Sarah appeared.\nSarah didn’t give me a chance to be quiet. I was on my own, sitting in the living room and listening to the television. “Help,” she said. “I need to find a way out.” I stayed silent. “You can hear me, can’t you?” she asked, surprised.\n“I’m not allowed to speak to you,” I told her.\n“Please,” she begged. “I’m scared, I’m lost. I want to see my daddy.” I gripped the arms of the chair and told her I wasn’t allowed.\n\n“He’s dead,” she said. I didn’t answer. “Your father is dead,” she said again.\nI wasn’t going to fall for it. I heard banging from around the room as things began to fly, and the shelves began to shake. “Stop it!” I shouted. And it did.\n“Please help me leave,” she said.\nI wasn’t going to talk to her. I did the only thing I thought would help. I unlocked the front door, hoping she’d run out and get lost, just like I would do. When I heard from her no more, I locked the door and sat back down. I listened intently for any signs she was still there. Except for the sounds of the TV, it was silent.\nI hated when my heart raced. I became all too aware of the tick-tock feeling of the rise and fall within my chest, like it was about to explode. When I heard my father’s voice, I screamed.\n“Son,” he said, “I need your help. I think I’m dying.”\nI did what he told me to do; I didn’t speak. If he did die, he’d never leave me. Instead, I raced out into the open air and shouted for help. I shouted until my voice was hoarse. I heard the sounds of cars racing along the road in front of my house. I shouted until I heard someone respond. It was a woman.\n“What’s wrong?” they asked. I told them I think my father was dying. They asked what had happened to my face. I pleaded with them to help me, and they promised they would.\nI sat down on the grass and waited. Sometime later, the woman returned to me and asked if she could hold my hand. “I’m so sorry,” she told me. I heard the sounds of sirens, and of people rushing. I asked what was going on. The woman said she was there for me.\nAs the noise died down, a man asked me a question. “I’m a paramedic,” he said. “What happened to your face?” I told him I was fine. He asked if I was sure, and I told him I was. He asked if I minded him touching my face. I said it was okay.\nA moment later, I felt a pressure release from around my forehead and the air felt cold against my skin. It sounded as if he were peeling an orange. I imagined that in my head and worried he’d expose my insides. I screamed and asked what he was doing. He told me everything was going to be okay, and the woman squeezed my hand, telling me to be brave.\n\nI didn’t know what it was I was experiencing. I felt a tight pain within my head, like when you smash your shin against something hard, followed by something I’ve come to understand as “bright”. It hurt so much. I began to cry.\n“What happened to your eyes?” the paramedic asked. I said I was blind. He asked to check them. The pain returned when he examined them.\n“Do you know him? the man asked the woman who had helped me. She told him that I had been screaming for help and that she had come to my aid, but that she had never met me before.\n“How long have you had your eye injury?” he asked me. I told him I’d been blind from birth. He asked me if I could see his fingers. I told him no. He asked if I could open my eyes. I said I didn’t know what he meant. He asked if he could open them for me. I didn’t respond. Then I felt his fingers on my face, fingers covered in something rubbery. Suddenly, it became “bright” again. I screamed.\nHe tried to calm me. The woman squeezed my hand again. I didn’t know what was happening. Things I couldn’t describe came to me. It was like it always was, but multiplied one hundred-fold, and so much more real. I carried on screaming as a fuzzy form came into view.\n“Just breathe, okay?” the paramedic said. “Everything will be fine. When was the last time you saw?” As my heart began to calm and my breathing slowed, I became distracted by what I was experiencing. It overwhelmed me. I wanted to cry, and I did. “How long has it been?” he asked again.\n“I’ve never seen anything before,” I told him.\n* * * * * *\nI was told to keep an eye mask on for most of the day, only taking it off at night at first, to allow my eyes time to adjust. At the same time, I was placed in the custody of my aunt and uncle, and didn’t even know it at first. They were shocked at what happened to me, and that I had never attended school.\nThe past few years have been a rollercoaster ride. The doctors said I may never have perfect vision, though what little I have is a Godsend, and I’ll take what I can get. I’ve only recently been learning to read and write, so I apologize if my English isn’t the greatest. It’s the best I can do.\nI’ve been asking my aunt what happened to my father, but all she says is that he died of a heart attack. I asked what sort of man he was. She says he was her brother and she’ll love him no matter what. My uncle doesn’t want to talk about him at all.\nI’ve been using the computer a lot recently, and really enjoying the internet. I can’t believe such a thing exists. After being so lonely for so long, I can talk to whoever I want, when I want, though I’m wary of that. After all, how do I know if who I’m speaking to is alive? No one seems to share my father’s concerns about that.\nToday I was on a forum discussing the spirit world – I was so happy to find people who I could relate to – and someone curious about my username sent me a link to an article on a true-crime website. It was about my father, and mentioned me by name. They asked me who I was, and if I was the same person. According to the article, my mother had gone missing soon after my birth. It said I’d been bound so that I couldn’t see. That my father always wanted a daughter.\nThey found fourteen bodies in the basement. They said one got away, a girl by the name of Sarah Frank. She was the one to call the police. They found Father’s car parked around the back of the house. They supposed he carried his victims into the basement via the storm entrance and left them there. Sarah had managed to get away after she agreed to be his daughter following four days of sustained torture. She stabbed him with a knife he’d placed on the counter to butter some toast.\nI didn’t want to believe it. And I am not sure I would have, if it weren’t for the names of the victims, two of which stuck out: Ellie Farmer and Alex Riddle. I’d spoken to them both in the living room.\nTo this day, I wonder if my father had been honest with me about a single thing in his life. Throughout it all, one question remains above all others.\nDid I speak to Ellie and Alex before, or after, he killed them?\n",

         " In 1984, there lived an old widowed lady by herself in a two story house who was completely immobile and bound to her wheelchair. Ever since the mysterious death of her husband, she required the aid of a carer who would visit her daily to help her with everyday tasks. What made it even more difficult, was the fact that the two floors of the house were only connected by an old staircase inside. When the old lady needed to move between the two, the carer would have to carry her frail body like an infant, up and down the stairs. One day the police received a call from the widow. There had been a murder.\n\nSince police units were scarce at the time, and the murderer had already fled the scene, only one detective was sent out to conduct the initial crime scene report. He arrived to see the carer’s body splayed out on the floor with her vocal chords ripped out in a pool of blood on the first level of the house, with the old lady atop the staircase in her wheelchair watching him, still and silently, seemingly in shock. He could immediately rule her out as a suspect, due to her inability to move up and down the stairs, and because she was trapped up there the time the murder took place. It was similar to the death of her husband many years ago, who had suffocated in his sleep on the couch downstairs.\nThe detective put on his gloves, took photos, swabbed for evidence, and covered the body until the coroner arrived later – all routine business. He scoped the house downstairs for any clues, then asked the old lady if he could look upstairs. She insisted that she was upstairs the whole time and no one apart from her had been up there that day, but regardless of this the detective ascended the staircase to which she hesitantly moved aside.\nBeyond the staircase, there was a narrow corridor, with three closed doors along it. He checked behind each of the doors, the empty bedroom – nothing, the bathroom- nothing. He became anxious as he slowly made his way to the final bedroom where the old lady slept. He opened it and everything looked normal. A bed, a wardrobe and a bedside table with a lamp. He checked every wall of the room in horror, as it was not what he discovered, but it was what he didn’t discover that made him stop dead in his tracks and slowly reach for his gun in its holster. It was a detail so minor that they had completely overlooked it on the last investigation of the husband’s death. There was no phone upstairs. He suddenly heard a noise as he withdrew his gun and rushed out of the room, only to find an empty wheelchair atop the stairs.\n\nCredit To: Jack\n\n\n",

         "While honeymooning in Maine, my wife and I stopped in the picturesque town of Boothbay on a particularly dreary and rainy day. Since our planned picnic was out of the question, we sought shelter in a dilapidated little antique store near the harbour. While my wife inspected the large chests and side tables near the door, I eagerly examined the antique tools and seafaring equipment inside the glass sales counter at the back. Being a collector of optics and mariner’s instruments, I hoped to find a sextant, or perhaps an old leather-bound telescope.\nA particularly interesting piece caught my eye. It appeared to be a heavy brass flashlight, bearing a worn brown patina but remarkably modern in design. I asked the shopkeeper, but he could only tell me it was found in the same old sailor’s chest as several of the compasses and the sextant also on display. He inquired as to whether I would like to purchase it for five dollars, or perhaps have it for free. “It’s worthless to me, nobody wants it.” When I remarked about the price, he sighed wearily, and then reached into the cabinet and retrieved it for me.\n\n“Here, see for yerself, feller.”\nThe craftsmanship was wonderful—quite durable and apparently hand-made, perhaps originating from somewhere in Europe. Worn lettering indicated it might be German, or perhaps Austrian, in origin. I twisted the bulb housing and a weak red beam swept out. Poking it into a dark corner of the shop, I was greeted with fantastic monotone swirls, moving and entwining with each other like a pit of eels. As I stared further into this unusual projector-kaleidescope, my fanciful mind invented ghoulish faces and sinuous, gnarled tendrils.\nShutting the device off, I turned excitedly to the shopkeeper. “Fantastic!” I said. “It must have an oil filter of sorts in front of the lens! I have two Victorian kalediscopes, but none that are illuminated like this.”\n“You don’t get it, do you? Nobody gets it. They all come back to return it after a while.” The shopkeeper leaned on the counter and I could see that he was breathing heavily and perspiring. “They all think it’s some sort of trick… till they start seeing it when the light’s off.”\n\n“That ain’t no projection, mister. That… damned thing, that light… it ain’t makin’ up those creatures. It’s just lettin’ your eyes see what’s already there.”\n\n\nPlease wait...\n",

         "It was the 2nd of January, 2:04 AM. I woke up to a knocking on the door. One knock every 3 seconds. I slipped on my slippers and walked down the stairs. As I walked down, the knocking on the door got faster, almost like a heartbeat. When I got to the door, the knocking stopped, I looked outside and nobody was there.\nI went back up to my room and went back to bed, thinking it was just some kids playing a prank. At 4:21 AM I woke up to the front door slamming shut. I jumped, terrified. I looked over at my frosted window to find “smile” written all over it in the frost. I grabbed my phone next to me, ready to call 911, only to find a message written on it saying “I told you to smile”. I cried and ran for my life running outside.\n\nAs soon as I got outside I knocked on my neighbors house across the road. They answered and held me while I sobbed. They phoned the police. At exactly 5:42, the police came to my neighbors house after an extensive search of my house. They told me there had been no evidence at all of anyone in my house other than me. The messages on the window were gone, same with my phone. They told me to get some sleep and advised me to see the doctor about stress and anxiety problems. Fuck that. I knew what happened to me was real.\nThe following evening, after spending the day at my neighbors, I went home. I went up to my bedroom and set up a camera. It was aimed at my bedroom door and my bed. I set it to record and went to sleep. Thankfully, I slept through the night. However, as I watched the footage, I couldn’t believe what I saw.\nAt 3 in the morning, something crawled out from under my bed. It was a completely naked, anorexic man. He stood  up and looked at me on the bed. He did so for another hour, not moving at all. Then he moved. He walked over to the camera until his face took up the whole shot. He was extremely pale and had bulging veins all over his head. His eyes were completely black, with a huge smile on his face. He stared at the camera for another two hours, not blinking, just slightly twisting his head every now and again.\nAfter two hours of him staring went past, he walked back over to my bed and crawled back under. I skipped the video forward until it showed me getting up and walking over to the camera. The video finished. I was frozen with fear. The video showed him going back under, but not leaving. Whatever it was, it was still there.\n\n",

         "January 19, 2003 —\nIndian officials ventured into a deep jungle, investigating several missing persons reports from a nearby city. What they found was a “Tower of Silence,” or dakhma. Zoroastrians use these sites to dispose of bodies in the open air.\nWhile sites like these are not uncommon in certain parts of india, several peculiarities hint at something more unusual…\n\nNone of the bodies depicted in the photograph were identified. Villagers from nearby, though initially surprised at the sheer number of corpses in the dakhma, proved unable to recognize the bodies. The corpses also do not match the descriptions of the missing people.\nThere were no animals around except for maggots and flies. Zoroastrians rely on birds (i.e. buzzards) to dispose of the bodies, in the belief they are contributing back to the Earth. Officials found the corpses relatively untouched by any sort of animal.\nThere is no official count of the bodies. In fact, little work was actually accomplished at the site and, perhaps, this is why only one photograph has emerged. Officials avoided the spot – not only because they felt uneasy looking at it, but for the following, as well:\nThe deep pit in the center of the photograph was filled with several feet of festering blood – far more than the bodies on the outside could ever supply. The stench was so unbearable that many of the officials began to get nauseous when they first approached the dakhma.\nThe expedition was ended when a villager accidentally kicked a small bone into the pit, penetrating the coagulated surface of the pool. A massive burst of gas from the decomposing blood erupted from the pit, splashing those looking into it, along with the photographer.\n\nThose caught in the explosion were immediately sent to the hospital, where they were quarrantined for possible infection. They became delirious with fever, shouting about “being tainted with the blood of Ahriman” (the personification of evil in Zoroastrianism), despite never having admitted having any familiarity with the religion.\nIn fact, many of them had no idea what the dakhma was when they had found it. Delirium turned to insanity as many began to attack hospital staff until they were sedated. The fever eventually killed all of them.\nWhen officials returned with HAZMAT gear the following day, the site was empty. All the bodies had been removed and, astonishingly, the pool of blood in the pit had been drained. All that remained of the incident was this photograph.\n\n\n\n",

         "It started with my 3 year old son screaming in his room in the middle of the night. When I came in to check on him he was in hysterics. Tears ran down his little cheeks as he cried about how the Boogeyman had frightened him. I let him sleep with my wife and I for the night, thinking it was just a bad dream.\nThe next evening he didn’t even want to be in his room, but I convinced him that the Boogey Man was just a figment of his imagination. I was awoken once more by his screams. I rushed to his room, to find him in tears again.\n\nOn the third night I set up a camcorder in his room, in order to show him that there was no monster. That evening there was no screaming and no crying. I was refreshed when I woke up in the morning after having gotten my first good nights sleep in three days. However, my son did seem fatigued. He didn’t even put up his usual fuss in the morning when we got him ready for preschool. When my wife took him to day care, I decided to review the camera’s tape in order to find out how he had slept. I’ll never forget what I saw.\nAt around 2AM while my son was asleep his closet door slowly creaked open. Out of the shadows crept a pale, naked, veiny, woman with long white hair and solid black eyes. Her body was bony and frail, like that of a holocaust survivor. When she turned to the side, I could see her spine protruding from her hunched back like a dinosaur. She reached into my son’s crib with her unnaturally large hands and covered his mouth. He was trying to scream, but he couldn’t. The palm of one of her hands easily enveloped his head, muffling his cries. She snatched him up with the ease that a person of her frame should not have had, then walked back into the closet with him in her arms. An hour later she returned with what looked like a wriggling maggot the size of a duffle bag and placed it in my son’s bed before retreating once more into the closet.\nOver the next 2 hours I watched it twist and writhe while it grew and mutated until it looked just like my baby boy. Once the transformation was complete, it got out of bed and slipped on a pair of his pajamas, then slid back between the covers and waited for us to come in. I don’t know what that thing is that left with my wife this morning, but I know it’s not my son.\n\nCredit To – Vincent Vena Cava\n\n\n",
